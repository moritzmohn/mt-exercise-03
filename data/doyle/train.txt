Good-bye , and God help you in your <unk> . ” She hurried from the room as <unk> as she had entered , and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street .
“ I am ashamed of you , Holmes , ” said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes ’ silence .
“ Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to <unk> ?
I am not <unk> of heart , but I call it cruel . ” “ I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy , ” said Holmes .
“ Have you an order to see him in prison ? ” “ Yes , but only for you and me . ” “ Then I shall <unk> my resolution about going out .
We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night ? ” “ Ample . ” “ Then let us do so .
Watson , I fear that you will find it very slow , but I shall only be away a couple of hours . ” I walked down to the station with them , and then wandered through the streets of the little town , finally returning to the hotel , where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel .
The <unk> plot of the story was so thin , however , when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping , and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact , that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day .
<unk> that this unhappy young man ’ s story were absolutely true , then what hellish thing , what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary <unk> could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father , and the moment when , drawn back by his <unk> , he rushed into the <unk> ?
It was something terrible and deadly .
What could it be ?
Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts ?
I rang the bell and called for the <unk> county paper , which contained a <unk> account of the inquest .
In the surgeon ’ s <unk> it was stated that the <unk> third of the left <unk> bone and the left half of the <unk> bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon .
I marked the spot upon my own head .
<unk> such a blow must have been struck from behind .
That was to some extent in favour of the accused , as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father .
Still , it did not go for very much , for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell .
Still , it might be worth while to call Holmes ’ attention to it .
Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat .
What could that mean ?
It could not be delirium .
A man dying from a sudden blow does not <unk> become delirious .
No , it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate .
But what could it indicate ?
I <unk> my brains to find some possible explanation .
And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy .
If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress , presumably his overcoat , in his flight , and must have had the <unk> to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was <unk> with his back turned not a dozen paces off .
What a <unk> of mysteries and <unk> the whole thing was !
I did not wonder at Lestrade ’ s opinion , and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes ’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy ’ s innocence .
It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned .
He came back alone , for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town .
“ The glass still keeps very high , ” he remarked as he sat down .
“ It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground .
On the other hand , a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that , and I did not wish to do it when <unk> by a long journey .
I have seen young McCarthy . ” “ And what did you learn from him ? ” “ Nothing . ” “ Could he throw no light ? ” “ None at all .
I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her , but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else .
He is not a very <unk> youth , though <unk> to look at and , I should think , sound at heart . ” “ I cannot admire his taste , ” I remarked , “ if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner . ” “ Ah , <unk> hangs a rather painful tale .
This fellow is <unk> , <unk> , in love with her , but some two years ago , when he was only a lad , and before he really knew her , for she had been away five years at a <unk> , what does the <unk> do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a <unk> office ?
No one knows a word of the matter , but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be <unk> for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do , but what he knows to be absolutely impossible .
It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father , at their last interview , was <unk> him on to propose to Miss Turner .
On the other hand , he had no means of <unk> himself , and his father , who was by all accounts a very hard man , would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth .
It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol , and his father did not know where he was .
<unk> that point .
It is of importance .
Good has come out of evil , however , for the barmaid , finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged , has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the <unk> <unk> , so that there is really no tie between them .
I think that that bit of news has <unk> young McCarthy for all that he has suffered . ” “ But if he is innocent , who has done it ? ” “ Ah !
who ?
I would call your attention very particularly to two points .
One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool , and that the someone could not have been his son , for his son was away , and he did not know when he would return .
The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘ Cooee ! ’ before he knew that his son had returned .
Those are the <unk> points upon which the case depends .
And now let us talk about George <unk> , if you please , and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow . ” There was no rain , as Holmes had <unk> , and the morning broke bright and cloudless .
At nine o ’ clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage , and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool .
“ There is serious news this morning , ” Lestrade observed .
“ It is said that Mr. Turner , of the Hall , is so ill that his life is <unk> of . ” “ An elderly man , I presume ? ” said Holmes .
“ About <unk> ; but his <unk> has been shattered by his life abroad , and he has been in failing health for some time .
This business has had a very bad effect upon him .
He was an old friend of McCarthy ’ s , and , I may add , a great benefactor to him , for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free . ” “ Indeed !
That is interesting , ” said Holmes .
“ Oh , yes !
In a hundred other ways he has helped him .
<unk> about here speaks of his kindness to him . ” “ Really !
Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy , who appears to have had little of his own , and to have been under such obligations to Turner , should still talk of marrying his son to Turner ’ s daughter , who is , presumably , heiress to the estate , and that in such a very <unk> manner , as if it were merely a case of a <unk> and all else would follow ?
It is the more strange , since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea .
The daughter told us as much .
Do you not deduce something from that ? ” “ We have got to the deductions and the inferences , ” said Lestrade , <unk> at me .
“ I find it hard enough to tackle facts , Holmes , without flying away after theories and fancies . ” “ You are right , ” said Holmes <unk> ; “ you do find it very hard to tackle the facts . ” “ Anyhow , I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of , ” replied Lestrade with some <unk> .
“ And that is — ” “ That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy <unk> and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine . ” “ Well , moonshine is a <unk> thing than fog , ” said Holmes , laughing .
“ But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left . ” “ Yes , that is it . ” It was a widespread , comfortable-looking building , two-storied , <unk> , with great yellow blotches of <unk> upon the grey walls .
The drawn blinds and the <unk> chimneys , however , gave it a stricken look , as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it .
We called at the door , when the maid , at Holmes ’ request , showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death , and also a pair of the son ’ s , though not the pair which he had then had .
Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points , Holmes desired to be led to the <unk> , from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool .
Sherlock Holmes was <unk> when he was hot upon such a scent as this .
Men who had only known the quiet thinker and <unk> of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him .
His face flushed and <unk> .
His brows were drawn into two hard black lines , while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a <unk> glitter .
His face was bent downward , his shoulders bowed , his lips compressed , and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long , <unk> neck .
His nostrils seemed to <unk> with a purely animal lust for the chase , and his mind was so absolutely <unk> upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell <unk> upon his ears , or , at the most , only provoked a quick , impatient snarl in reply .
Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows , and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool .
It was damp , <unk> ground , as is all that district , and there were marks of many feet , both upon the path and amid the short grass which <unk> it on either side .
Sometimes Holmes would hurry on , sometimes stop dead , and once he made quite a little <unk> into the <unk> .
Lestrade and I walked behind him , the detective <unk> and <unk> , while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end .
The Boscombe Pool , which is a little <unk> sheet of water some fifty yards across , is situated at the <unk> between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner .
Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red , <unk> <unk> which marked the <unk> of the rich landowner ’ s <unk> .
On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick , and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake .
Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found , and , indeed , so moist was the ground , that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man .
To Holmes , as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes , very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass .
He ran round , like a dog who is picking up a scent , and then turned upon my companion .
“ What did you go into the pool for ? ” he asked .
“ I <unk> about with a <unk> .
I thought there might be some weapon or other trace .
But how on earth — ” “ Oh , tut , tut !
I have no time !
That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place .
A mole could trace it , and there it <unk> among the reeds .
Oh , how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all over it .
Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came , and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body .
But here are three separate tracks of the same feet . ” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view , talking all the time rather to himself than to us .
“ These are young McCarthy ’ s feet .
Twice he was walking , and once he ran swiftly , so that the <unk> are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible .
That bears out his story .
He ran when he saw his father on the ground .
Then here are the father ’ s feet as he paced up and down .
What is this , then ?
It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening .
And this ?
Ha , ha !
What have we here ?
<unk> !
<unk> !
Square , too , quite unusual boots !
They come , they go , they come again — of course that was for the cloak .
Now where did they come from ? ” He ran up and down , sometimes losing , sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great <unk> , the largest tree in the neighbourhood .
Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction .
For a long time he remained there , turning over the leaves and dried sticks , gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach .
A <unk> stone was lying among the moss , and this also he carefully examined and retained .
Then he followed a <unk> through the wood until he came to the highroad , where all traces were lost .
“ It has been a case of considerable interest , ” he remarked , returning to his natural manner .
“ I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge .
I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran , and perhaps write a little note .
Having done that , we may drive back to our <unk> .
You may walk to the cab , and I shall be with you presently . ” It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross , Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood .
“ This may interest you , Lestrade , ” he remarked , holding it out .
“ The murder was done with it . ” “ I see no marks . ” “ There are none . ” “ How do you know , then ? ” “ The grass was growing under it .
It had only <unk> there a few days .
There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken .
It corresponds with the injuries .
There is no sign of any other weapon . ” “ And the murderer ? ” “ Is a tall man , left-handed , <unk> with the right leg , <unk> <unk> <unk> and a grey cloak , smokes Indian cigars , uses a cigar-holder , and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket .
There are several other indications , but these may be enough to aid us in our search . ” Lestrade laughed .
“ I am afraid that I am still a <unk> , ” he said .
“ <unk> are all very well , but we have to deal with a <unk> British jury . ” “ _ <unk> <unk> _ , ” answered Holmes calmly .
“ You work your own method , and I shall work mine .
I shall be busy this afternoon , and shall probably return to London by the evening train . ” “ And leave your case <unk> ? ” “ No , finished . ” “ But the mystery ? ” “ It is solved . ” “ Who was the criminal , then ? ” “ The gentleman I describe . ” “ But who is he ? ” “ Surely it would not be difficult to find out .
This is not such a <unk> neighbourhood . ” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders .
“ I am a practical man , ” he said , “ and I really cannot <unk> to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg .
I should become the <unk> of Scotland Yard . ” “ All right , ” said Holmes quietly .
“ I have given you the chance .
Here are your lodgings .
Good-bye .
I shall drop you a line before I leave . ” Having left Lestrade at his rooms , we drove to our hotel , where we found lunch upon the table .
Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a <unk> expression upon his face , as one who finds himself in a <unk> position .
“ Look here , Watson , ” he said when the cloth was cleared “ just sit down in this chair and let me <unk> to you for a little .
I don ’ t know quite what to do , and I should value your advice .
<unk> a cigar and let me <unk> . ” “ Pray do so . ” “ Well , now , in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy ’ s narrative which struck us both instantly , although they impressed me in his favour and you against him .
One was the fact that his father should , according to his account , cry ‘ Cooee ! ’ before seeing him .
The other was his singular dying reference to a rat .
He mumbled several words , you understand , but that was all that caught the son ’ s ear .
Now from this double point our research must commence , and we will begin it by <unk> that what the lad says is absolutely true . ” “ What of this ‘ Cooee ! ’ then ? ” “ Well , obviously it could not have been meant for the son .
The son , as far as he knew , was in Bristol .
It was mere chance that he was within <unk> .
The ‘ Cooee ! ’ was meant to <unk> the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with .
But ‘ Cooee ’ is a distinctly Australian cry , and one which is used between <unk> .
There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia . ” “ What of the rat , then ? ” Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table .
“ This is a map of the <unk> of Victoria , ” he said .
“ I wired to Bristol for it last night . ” He put his hand over part of the map .
“ What do you read ? ” “ <unk> , ” I read .
“ And now ? ” He raised his hand .
“ <unk> . ” “ Quite so .
That was the word the man uttered , and of which his son only caught the last two <unk> .
He was trying to utter the name of his murderer .
So and so , of Ballarat . ” “ It is wonderful ! ” I exclaimed .
“ It is obvious .
And now , you see , I had <unk> the field down considerably .
The possession of a grey <unk> was a third point which , <unk> the son ’ s statement to be correct , was a certainty .
We have come now out of mere <unk> to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak . ” “ Certainly . ” “ And one who was at home in the district , for the pool can only be approached by the <unk> or by the estate , where strangers could hardly wander . ” “ Quite so . ” “ Then comes our expedition of to-day .
By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade , as to the <unk> of the criminal . ” “ But how did you gain them ? ” “ You know my method .
It is founded upon the observation of trifles . ” “ His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride .
His boots , too , might be told from their traces . ” “ Yes , they were peculiar boots . ” “ But his <unk> ? ” “ The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left .
He put less weight upon it .
Why ?
Because he <unk> — he was <unk> . ” “ But his <unk> . ” “ You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest .
The blow was struck from immediately behind , and yet was upon the left side .
Now , how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man ?
He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son .
He had even smoked there .
I found the ash of a cigar , which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes <unk> me to pronounce as an Indian cigar .
I have , as you know , devoted some attention to this , and written a little monograph on the ashes of <unk> different <unk> of pipe , cigar , and cigarette tobacco .
Having found the ash , I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it .
It was an Indian cigar , of the variety which are rolled in <unk> . ” “ And the cigar-holder ? ” “ I could see that the end had not been in his mouth .
Therefore he used a holder .
The <unk> had been cut off , not bitten off , but the cut was not a clean one , so I deduced a blunt pen-knife . ” “ Holmes , ” I said , “ you have drawn a <unk> round this man from which he cannot escape , and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him .
I see the direction in which all this points .
The culprit is — ” “ Mr.
John Turner , ” cried the hotel <unk> , opening the door of our sitting-room , and <unk> in a visitor .
The man who entered was a strange and <unk> figure .
His slow , <unk> step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of <unk> , and yet his hard , <unk> , <unk> features , and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character .
His tangled beard , grizzled hair , and outstanding , drooping eyebrows <unk> to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance , but his face was of an ashen white , while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were <unk> with a shade of blue .
It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and <unk> disease .
“ Pray sit down on the sofa , ” said Holmes gently .
“ You had my note ? ” “ Yes , the lodge-keeper brought it up .
You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal . ” “ I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall . ” “ And why did you wish to see me ? ” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes , as though his question was already answered .
“ Yes , ” said Holmes , answering the look rather than the words .
“ It is so .
I know all about McCarthy . ” The old man sank his face in his hands .
“ God help me ! ” he cried .
“ But I would not have let the young man come to harm .
I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes . ” “ I am glad to hear you say so , ” said Holmes gravely .
“ I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl .
It would break her heart — it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested . ” “ It may not come to that , ” said Holmes .
“ What ? ” “ I am no official agent .
I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here , and I am acting in her interests .
Young McCarthy must be got off , however . ” “ I am a dying man , ” said old Turner .
“ I have had <unk> for years .
My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month .
Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol . ” Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him .
“ Just tell us the truth , ” he said .
“ I shall <unk> down the facts .
You will sign it , and Watson here can witness it .
Then I could produce your confession at the last <unk> to save young McCarthy .
I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed . ” “ It ’ s as well , ” said the old man ; “ it ’ s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes , so it matters little to me , but I should wish to spare Alice the shock .
And now I will make the thing clear to you ; it has been a long time in the acting , but will not take me long to tell .
“ You didn ’ t know this dead man , McCarthy .
He was a devil <unk> .
I tell you that .
God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he .
His grip has been upon me these twenty years , and he has <unk> my life .
I ’ ll tell you first how I came to be in his power .
“ It was in the early ’ 60 ’ s at the diggings .
I was a young chap then , <unk> and reckless , ready to turn my hand at anything ; I got among bad companions , took to drink , had no luck with my claim , took to the <unk> , and in a word became what you would call over here a highway <unk> .
There were six of us , and we had a wild , free life of it , sticking up a station from time to time , or <unk> the <unk> on the road to the diggings .
Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under , and our party is still remembered in the <unk> as the Ballarat <unk> .
“ One day a gold <unk> came down from Ballarat to <unk> , and we lay in wait for it and attacked it .
There were six <unk> and six of us , so it was a close thing , but we <unk> four of their <unk> at the first <unk> .
Three of our <unk> were killed , however , before we got the <unk> .
I put my pistol to the head of the <unk> , who was this very man McCarthy .
I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then , but I spared him , though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face , as though to remember every feature .
We got away with the gold , became wealthy men , and made our way over to England without being suspected .
There I parted from my old <unk> and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life .
I bought this estate , which <unk> to be in the market , and I set myself to do a little good with my money , to make up for the way in which I had <unk> it .
I married , too , and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice .
Even when she was just a baby her <unk> hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done .
In a word , I turned over a new <unk> and did my best to make up for the past .
All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me .
“ I had gone up to town about an <unk> , and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot .
“ ‘ Here we are , Jack , ’ says he , <unk> me on the arm ; ‘ we ’ ll be as good as a family to you .
There ’ s two of us , me and my son , and you can have the keeping of us .
If you don ’ t — it ’ s a fine , <unk> country is England , and there ’ s always a policeman within <unk> . ’ “ Well , down they came to the west country , there was no shaking them off , and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since .
There was no rest for me , no peace , no <unk> ; turn where I would , there was his cunning , grinning face at my elbow .
It grew worse as Alice grew up , for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police .
Whatever he wanted he must have , and whatever it was I gave him without question , land , money , houses , until at last he asked a thing which I could not give .
He asked for Alice .
“ His son , you see , had grown up , and so had my girl , and as I was known to be in weak health , it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property .
But there I was firm .
I would not have his <unk> stock mixed with mine ; not that I had any dislike to the lad , but his blood was in him , and that was enough .
I stood firm .
McCarthy threatened .
I braved him to do his worst .
We were to meet at the pool <unk> between our houses to talk it over .
“ When I went down there I found him talking with his son , so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone .
But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come <unk> .
He was <unk> his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a <unk> from off the streets .
It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this .
Could I not snap the <unk> ?
I was already a dying and a desperate man .
<unk> clear of mind and fairly strong of limb , I knew that my own fate was sealed .
But my memory and my girl !
Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue .
I did it , Mr. Holmes .
I would do it again .
<unk> as I have <unk> , I have led a life of <unk> to <unk> for it .
But that my girl should be entangled in the same <unk> which held me was more than I could suffer .
I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and <unk> <unk> .
His cry brought back his son ; but I had gained the cover of the wood , though I was forced to go back to <unk> the cloak which I had dropped in my flight .
That is the true story , gentlemen , of all that occurred . ” “ Well , it is not for me to judge you , ” said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out .
“ I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation . ” “ I pray not , sir .
And what do you <unk> to do ? ” “ In view of your health , nothing .
You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes .
I will keep your confession , and if McCarthy is <unk> I shall be forced to use it .
If not , it shall never be seen by <unk> eye ; and your secret , whether you be alive or dead , shall be safe with us . ” “ <unk> , then , ” said the old man solemnly .
“ Your own <unk> , when they come , will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine . ” <unk> and shaking in all his giant frame , he <unk> slowly from the room .
“ God help us ! ” said Holmes after a long silence .
“ Why does fate play such <unk> with poor , helpless <unk> ?
I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of <unk> ’ s words , and say , ‘ There , but for the grace of God , goes Sherlock Holmes . ’ ” James McCarthy was <unk> at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the <unk> <unk> .
Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview , but he is now dead ; and there is every <unk> that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which <unk> upon their past .
V. THE <unk> <unk> <unk> When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years ’ <unk> and ’ 90 , I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave .
Some , however , have already gained publicity through the papers , and others have not offered a field for those peculiar <unk> which my friend possessed in so high a degree , and which it is the object of these papers to <unk> .
Some , too , have baffled his analytical skill , and would be , as narratives , <unk> without an ending , while others have been but <unk> cleared up , and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him .
There is , however , one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so <unk> in its results that I am <unk> to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been , and probably never will be , entirely cleared up .
The year ’ <unk> furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest , of which I retain the records .
Among my <unk> under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who held a <unk> club in the lower vault of a furniture <unk> , of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque _ <unk> <unk> _ , of the singular adventures of the <unk> <unk> in the island of <unk> , and finally of the Camberwell <unk> case .
In the latter , as may be remembered , Sherlock Holmes was able , by winding up the dead man ’ s watch , to prove that it had been wound up two hours before , and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time — a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case .
All these I may sketch out at some future date , but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe .
It was in the latter days of <unk> , and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence .
All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows , so that even here in the heart of great , <unk> London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great <unk> <unk> which shriek at <unk> through the bars of his <unk> , like <unk> <unk> in a <unk> .
As evening drew in , the storm grew higher and louder , and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney .
Sherlock Holmes sat <unk> at one side of the fireplace <unk> his records of crime , while I at the other was deep in one of <unk> <unk> ’ s fine <unk> until the <unk> of the gale from without seemed to <unk> with the <unk> , and the splash of the rain to <unk> out into the long <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
My wife was on a visit to her mother ’ s , and for a few days I was a <unk> once more in my old quarters at Baker Street .
“ Why , ” said I , glancing up at my companion , “ that was surely the bell .
Who could come to-night ?
Some friend of yours , perhaps ? ” “ Except yourself I have none , ” he answered .
“ I do not <unk> visitors . ” “ A client , then ? ” “ If so , it is a serious case .
Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour .
But I take it that it is more likely to be some <unk> of the landlady ’ s . ” Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture , however , for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door .
He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the <unk> chair upon which a newcomer must sit .
“ Come in ! ” said he .
The man who entered was young , some <unk> at the outside , <unk> and <unk> clad , with something of <unk> and delicacy in his bearing .
The <unk> umbrella which he held in his hand , and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come .
He looked about him <unk> in the glare of the lamp , and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy , like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety .
“ I owe you an apology , ” he said , raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes .
“ I trust that I am not <unk> .
I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your <unk> chamber . ” “ Give me your coat and umbrella , ” said Holmes .
“ They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently .
You have come up from the <unk> , I see . ” “ Yes , from Horsham . ” “ That clay and <unk> mixture which I see upon your toe <unk> is quite <unk> . ” “ I have come for advice . ” “ That is easily got . ” “ And help . ” “ That is not always so easy . ” “ I have heard of you , Mr. Holmes .
I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the <unk> <unk> scandal . ” “ Ah , of course .
He was wrongfully accused of <unk> at cards . ” “ He said that you could solve anything . ” “ He said too much . ” “ That you are never beaten . ” “ I have been beaten four times — three times by men , and once by a woman . ” “ But what is that compared with the number of your <unk> ? ” “ It is true that I have been generally successful . ” “ Then you may be so with me . ” “ I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case . ” “ It is no ordinary one . ” “ None of those which come to me are .
I am the last court of <unk> . ” “ And yet I question , sir , whether , in all your experience , you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family . ” “ You fill me with interest , ” said Holmes .
“ Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement , and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important . ” The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze .
“ My name , ” said he , “ is John Openshaw , but my own affairs have , as far as I can understand , little to do with this awful business .
It is a hereditary matter ; so in order to give you an idea of the facts , I must go back to the commencement of the affair .
“ You must know that my grandfather had two <unk> — my uncle Elias and my father <unk> .
My father had a small <unk> at <unk> , which he <unk> at the time of the <unk> of <unk> .
He was a <unk> of the Openshaw <unk> <unk> , and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome <unk> .
“ My uncle Elias <unk> to America when he was a young man and became a <unk> in Florida , where he was reported to have done very well .
At the time of the war he <unk> in <unk> ’ s army , and afterwards under <unk> , where he rose to be a colonel .
When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation , where he remained for three or four years .
About 1869 or <unk> he came back to Europe and took a small estate in <unk> , near Horsham .
He had made a very considerable fortune in the States , and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the <unk> , and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the <unk> to them .
He was a singular man , fierce and <unk> , very <unk> when he was angry , and of a most retiring disposition .
During all the years that he lived at Horsham , I doubt if ever he set foot in the town .
He had a garden and two or three fields round his house , and there he would take his exercise , though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room .
He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily , but he would see no society and did not want any friends , not even his own brother .
“ He didn ’ t mind me ; in fact , he took a fancy to me , for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so .
This would be in the year <unk> , after he had been eight or nine years in England .
He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way .
When he was <unk> he used to be fond of playing <unk> and <unk> with me , and he would make me his <unk> both with the servants and with the <unk> , so that by the time that I was <unk> I was quite master of the house .
I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked , so long as I did not disturb him in his <unk> .
There was one singular exception , however , for he had a single room , a lumber-room up among the <unk> , which was invariably locked , and which he would never <unk> either me or anyone else to enter .
With a boy ’ s curiosity I have peeped through the <unk> , but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old <unk> and <unk> as would be expected in such a room .
“ One day — it was in March , 1883 — a letter with a foreign <unk> lay upon the table in front of the colonel ’ s plate .
It was not a common thing for him to receive letters , for his bills were all paid in ready money , and he had no friends of any sort .
‘ From India ! ’ said he as he took it up , ‘ Pondicherry postmark !
What can this be ? ’ <unk> it hurriedly , out there jumped five little dried orange pips , which pattered down upon his plate .
I began to laugh at this , but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face .
His lip had fallen , his eyes were protruding , his skin the colour of putty , and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand , ‘ K.
K. K. ! ’ he shrieked , and then , ‘ My God , my God , my sins have <unk> me ! ’ “ ‘ What is it , uncle ? ’ I cried .
“ ‘ <unk> , ’ said he , and rising from the table he retired to his room , leaving me palpitating with horror .
I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap , just above the <unk> , the letter K three times repeated .
There was nothing else save the five dried pips .
What could be the reason of his overpowering terror ?
I left the breakfast-table , and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key , which must have belonged to the attic , in one hand , and a small brass box , like a <unk> , in the other .
“ ‘ They may do what they like , but I ’ ll <unk> them still , ’ said he with an <unk> .
‘ Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day , and send down to Fordham , the Horsham lawyer . ’ “ I did as he ordered , and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room .
The fire was burning brightly , and in the grate there was a mass of black , fluffy ashes , as of burned paper , while the brass box stood open and empty beside it .
As I glanced at the box I noticed , with a start , that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope .
“ ‘ I wish you , John , ’ said my uncle , ‘ to witness my will .
I leave my estate , with all its advantages and all its <unk> , to my brother , your father , whence it will , no doubt , <unk> to you .
If you can <unk> it in peace , well and good !
If you find you cannot , take my advice , my boy , and leave it to your deadliest enemy .
I am sorry to give you such a <unk> thing , but I can ’ t say what turn things are going to take .
Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you . ’ “ I signed the paper as directed , and the lawyer took it away with him .
The singular incident made , as you may think , the deepest impression upon me , and I <unk> over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it .
Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind , though the <unk> grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives .
I could see a change in my uncle , however .
He drank more than ever , and he was less inclined for any sort of society .
Most of his time he would spend in his room , with the door locked upon the inside , but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand , screaming out that he was afraid of no man , and that he was not to be <unk> up , like a <unk> in a pen , by man or devil .
When these hot fits were over , however , he would rush <unk> in at the door and lock and bar it behind him , like a man who can <unk> it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul .
At such times I have seen his face , even on a cold day , <unk> with moisture , as though it were new raised from a basin .
“ Well , to come to an end of the matter , Mr. Holmes , and not to <unk> your patience , there came a night when he made one of those drunken <unk> from which he never came back .
We found him , when we went to search for him , face downward in a little <unk> pool , which lay at the foot of the garden .
There was no sign of any violence , and the water was but two feet deep , so that the jury , having regard to his known eccentricity , brought in a verdict of ‘ suicide . ’ But I , who knew how he <unk> from the very thought of death , had much <unk> to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it .
The matter passed , however , and my father entered into possession of the estate , and of some £ <unk> , which lay to his credit at the bank . ” “ One moment , ” Holmes <unk> , “ your statement is , I foresee , one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened .
Let me have the date of the <unk> by your uncle of the letter , and the date of his <unk> suicide . ” “ The letter arrived on March 10 , 1883 .
His death was seven weeks later , upon the night of May <unk> . ” “ Thank you .
Pray proceed . ” “ When my father took over the Horsham property , he , at my request , made a careful examination of the attic , which had been always locked up .
We found the brass box there , although its contents had been destroyed .
On the inside of the cover was a paper <unk> , with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it , and ‘ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a register ’ written beneath .
These , we presume , indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw .
For the rest , there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and <unk> bearing upon my uncle ’ s life in America .
Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave <unk> .
<unk> were of a date during the <unk> of the Southern states , and were mostly concerned with politics , for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the <unk> <unk> who had been sent down from the North .
“ Well , it was the beginning of ’ 84 when my father came to live at Horsham , and all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’ 85 .
On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table .
There he was , sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one .
He had always laughed at what he called my <unk> story about the colonel , but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself .
“ ‘ Why , what on earth does this mean , John ? ’ he stammered .
“ My heart had turned to lead .
‘ It is K. K. K. , ’ said I.
“ He looked inside the envelope .
‘ So it is , ’ he cried .
‘ Here are the very letters .
But what is this written above them ? ’ “ ‘ Put the papers on the sundial , ’ I read , <unk> over his shoulder .
“ ‘ What papers ?
What sundial ? ’ he asked .
“ ‘ The sundial in the garden .
There is no other , ’ said I ; ‘ but the papers must be those that are destroyed . ’ “ ‘ Pooh ! ’ said he , <unk> hard at his <unk> .
‘ We are in a <unk> land here , and we can ’ t have <unk> of this kind .
Where does the thing come from ? ’ “ ‘ From Dundee , ’ I answered , glancing at the postmark .
“ ‘ Some preposterous practical joke , ’ said he .
‘ What have I to do with <unk> and papers ?
I shall take no notice of such nonsense . ’ “ ‘ I should certainly speak to the police , ’ I said .
“ ‘ And be laughed at for my pains .
Nothing of the sort . ’ “ ‘ Then let me do so ? ’ “ ‘ No , I <unk> you .
I won ’ t have a fuss made about such nonsense . ’ “ It was in vain to <unk> with him , for he was a very obstinate man .
I went about , however , with a heart which was full of <unk> .
“ On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his , Major <unk> , who is in command of one of the <unk> upon <unk> <unk> .
I was glad that he should go , for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home .
In that , however , I was in error .
Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major , <unk> me to come at once .
My father had fallen over one of the deep <unk> which <unk> in the neighbourhood , and was lying senseless , with a shattered <unk> .
I hurried to him , but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness .
He had , as it appears , been returning from <unk> in the <unk> , and as the country was unknown to him , and the <unk> <unk> , the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘ death from <unk> causes . ’ <unk> as I examined every fact connected with his death , I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder .
There were no signs of violence , no footmarks , no robbery , no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads .
And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease , and that I was <unk> certain that some foul plot had been woven round him .
“ In this sinister way I came into my <unk> .
You will ask me why I did not <unk> of it ?
I answer , because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way <unk> upon an incident in my uncle ’ s life , and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another .
“ It was in January , ’ 85 , that my poor father met his end , and two years and eight months have elapsed since then .
During that time I have lived happily at Horsham , and I had begun to hope that this <unk> had passed away from the family , and that it had ended with the last <unk> .
I had begun to take <unk> too soon , however ; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father . ” The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope , and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips .
“ This is the envelope , ” he continued .
“ The postmark is London — <unk> division .
Within are the very words which were upon my father ’ s last message : ‘ K.
K. K. ’ ; and then ‘ Put the papers on the sundial . ’ ” “ What have you done ? ” asked Holmes .
“ Nothing . ” “ Nothing ? ” “ To tell the truth ” — he sank his face into his thin , white hands — “ I have felt helpless .
I have felt like one of those poor <unk> when the snake is writhing towards it .
I seem to be in the grasp of some <unk> , inexorable evil , which no foresight and no <unk> can guard against . ” “ Tut !
tut ! ” cried Sherlock Holmes .
“ You must act , man , or you are lost .
Nothing but energy can save you .
This is no time for despair . ” “ I have seen the police . ” “ Ah ! ” “ But they listened to my story with a smile .
I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical <unk> , and that the deaths of my relations were really <unk> , as the jury stated , and were not to be connected with the warnings . ” Holmes shook his <unk> hands in the air .
“ <unk> <unk> ! ” he cried .
“ They have , however , allowed me a policeman , who may remain in the house with me . ” “ Has he come with you to-night ? ” “ No .
His orders were to stay in the house . ” Again Holmes <unk> in the air .
“ Why did you come to me ? ” he said , “ and , above all , why did you not come at once ? ” “ I did not know .
It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was <unk> by him to come to you . ” “ It is really two days since you had the letter .
We should have acted before this .
You have no further evidence , I suppose , than that which you have placed before us — no suggestive detail which might help us ? ” “ There is one thing , ” said John Openshaw .
He rummaged in his coat pocket , and , drawing out a piece of discoloured , <unk> paper , he laid it out upon the table .
“ I have some <unk> , ” said he , “ that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small , <unk> <unk> which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour .
I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room , and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has , perhaps , fluttered out from among the others , and in that way has escaped <unk> .
Beyond the mention of pips , I do not see that it <unk> us much .
I think myself that it is a page from some private diary .
The writing is undoubtedly my uncle ’ s . ” Holmes moved the lamp , and we both bent over the sheet of paper , which showed by its <unk> edge that it had indeed been torn from a book .
It was headed , “ March , 1869 , ” and beneath were the following <unk> notices : “ 4th .
Hudson came .
<unk> old platform .
“ <unk> .
<unk> the pips on McCauley , Paramore , and John Swain of St. <unk> .
“ 9th .
McCauley cleared .
“ <unk> .
John Swain cleared .
“ <unk> .
<unk> Paramore .
All well . ” “ Thank you ! ” said Holmes , <unk> up the paper and returning it to our visitor .
“ And now you must on no account lose another instant .
We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me .
You must get home instantly and act . ” “ What shall I do ? ” “ There is but one thing to do .
It must be done at once .
You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described .
You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle , and that this is the only one which remains .
You must <unk> that in such words as will carry conviction with them .
Having done this , you must at once put the box out upon the sundial , as directed .
Do you understand ? ” “ Entirely . ” “ Do not think of revenge , or anything of the sort , at present .
I think that we may gain that by means of the law ; but we have our web to <unk> , while <unk> is already woven .
The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which <unk> you .
The second is to clear up the mystery and to <unk> the guilty <unk> . ” “ I thank you , ” said the young man , rising and pulling on his overcoat .
“ You have given me fresh life and hope .
I shall certainly do as you advise . ” “ Do not lose an instant .
And , above all , take care of yourself in the <unk> , for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and <unk> danger .
How do you go back ? ” “ By train from Waterloo . ” “ It is not yet nine .
The streets will be crowded , so I trust that you may be in safety .
And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely . ” “ I am armed . ” “ That is well .
<unk> I shall set to work upon your case . ” “ I shall see you at Horsham , then ? ” “ No , your secret lies in London .
It is there that I shall seek it . ” “ Then I shall call upon you in a day , or in two days , with news as to the box and the papers .
I shall take your advice in every particular . ” He shook hands with us and took his leave .
Outside the wind still screamed and the rain <unk> and pattered against the windows .
This strange , wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad <unk> — <unk> in upon us like a sheet of <unk> in a gale — and now to have been <unk> by them once more .
Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence , with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red <unk> of the fire .
Then he lit his pipe , and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue <unk> as they <unk> each other up to the ceiling .
“ I think , Watson , ” he remarked at last , “ that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this . ” “ Save , perhaps , the Sign of Four . ” “ Well , yes .
Save , perhaps , that .
And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the <unk> . ” “ But have you , ” I asked , “ formed any definite conception as to what these perils are ? ” “ There can be no question as to their nature , ” he answered .
“ Then what are they ?
Who is this K. K. K. , and why does he <unk> this unhappy family ? ” Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair , with his finger-tips together .
“ The ideal reasoner , ” he remarked , “ would , when he had once been shown a single fact in all its <unk> , deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it .
As <unk> could <unk> describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone , so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to <unk> state all the other ones , both before and after .
We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to .
<unk> may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have <unk> a solution by the aid of their senses .
To carry the art , however , to its highest pitch , it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to <unk> all the facts which have come to his knowledge ; and this in itself <unk> , as you will readily see , a possession of all knowledge , which , even in these days of free education and <unk> , is a somewhat rare <unk> .
It is not so impossible , however , that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work , and this I have endeavoured in my case to do .
If I remember <unk> , you on one occasion , in the early days of our <unk> , defined my limits in a very precise fashion . ” “ Yes , ” I answered , laughing .
“ It was a singular <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and politics were marked at <unk> , I remember .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> profound as regards the <unk> from any <unk> within fifty miles of town , <unk> eccentric , <unk> <unk> , sensational literature and crime records unique , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , lawyer , and <unk> by cocaine and tobacco .
Those , I think , were the main points of my analysis . ” Holmes <unk> at the last item .
“ Well , ” he said , “ I say now , as I said then , that a man should keep his little <unk> <unk> with all the furniture that he is likely to use , and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library , where he can get it if he wants it .
Now , for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night , we need certainly to <unk> all our resources .
Kindly hand me down the letter K of the _ American Encyclopædia _ which stands upon the shelf beside you .
Thank you .
Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it .
In the first place , we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America .
Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange <unk> the charming <unk> of Florida for the lonely life of an English <unk> town .
His extreme love of <unk> in England <unk> the idea that he was in fear of someone or something , so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America .
As to what it was he feared , we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his <unk> .
Did you remark the <unk> of those letters ? ” “ The first was from Pondicherry , the second from Dundee , and the third from London . ” “ From <unk> London .
What do you deduce from that ? ” “ They are all <unk> .
That the writer was on board of a ship . ” “ Excellent .
We have already a clue .
There can be no doubt that the probability — the strong probability — is that the writer was on board of a ship .
And now let us consider another point .
In the case of Pondicherry , seven weeks elapsed between the <unk> and its <unk> , in Dundee it was only some three or four days .
Does that suggest anything ? ” “ A greater distance to travel . ” “ But the letter had also a greater distance to come . ” “ Then I do not see the point . ” “ There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship .
It looks as if they always send their singular warning or <unk> before them when starting upon their mission .
You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee .
If they had come from Pondicherry in a <unk> they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter .
But , as a matter of fact , seven weeks elapsed .
I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the <unk> vessel which brought the writer . ” “ It is possible . ” “ More than that .
It is probable .
And now you see the deadly <unk> of this new case , and why I urged young Openshaw to <unk> .
The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the <unk> to travel the distance .
But this one comes from London , and therefore we cannot <unk> upon delay . ” “ Good God ! ” I cried .
“ What can it mean , this relentless <unk> ? ” “ The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship .
I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them .
A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to <unk> a coroner ’ s jury .
There must have been several in it , and they must have been men of resource and <unk> .
Their papers they mean to have , be the holder of them who it may .
In this way you see K. K. K. <unk> to be the initials of an individual and becomes the <unk> of a society . ” “ But of what society ? ” “ Have you never — ” said Sherlock Holmes , bending forward and sinking his voice — “ have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan ? ” “ I never have . ” Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee .
“ Here it is , ” said he presently : “ ‘ Ku Klux Klan .
A name derived from the <unk> resemblance to the sound produced by <unk> a <unk> .
This terrible secret society was formed by some <unk> <unk> in the Southern states after the <unk> War , and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , Georgia , and Florida .
Its power was used for political purposes , <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and driving from the country of those who were <unk> to its views .
Its outrages were usually <unk> by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape — a <unk> of <unk> in some parts , <unk> <unk> or orange pips in others .
On receiving this the victim might either openly <unk> his former ways , or might fly from the country .
If he braved the matter out , death would <unk> come upon him , and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner .
So perfect was the organisation of the society , and so <unk> its methods , that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in <unk> it with impunity , or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the <unk> .
For some years the organisation <unk> in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better <unk> of the <unk> in the South .
<unk> , in the year 1869 , the movement rather suddenly collapsed , although there have been <unk> <unk> of the same sort since that date . ’ “ You will observe , ” said Holmes , laying down the volume , “ that the sudden breaking up of the society was <unk> with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers .
It may well have been cause and effect .
It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more <unk> spirits upon their track .
You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South , and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered . ” “ Then the page we have seen — ” “ Is such as we might expect .
It ran , if I remember right , ‘ sent the pips to A , B , and C ’ — that is , sent the society ’ s warning to them .
Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared , or left the country , and finally that C was visited , with , I fear , a sinister result for <unk> Well , I think , Doctor , that we may let some light into this dark place , and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him .
There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night , so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men . ” It had cleared in the morning , and the sun was shining with a subdued <unk> through the dim veil which hangs over the great city .
Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down .
“ You will excuse me for not waiting for you , ” said he ; “ I have , I foresee , a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw ’ s . ” “ What steps will you take ? ” I asked .
“ It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries .
I may have to go down to Horsham , after all . ” “ You will not go there first ? ” “ No , I shall commence with the City .
Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee . ” As I waited , I lifted the <unk> newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it .
It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart .
“ Holmes , ” I cried , “ you are too late . ” “ Ah ! ” said he , laying down his cup , “ I feared as much .
How was it done ? ” He spoke calmly , but I could see that he was deeply moved .
“ My eye caught the name of Openshaw , and the heading ‘ <unk> Near Waterloo Bridge . ’ Here is the account : “ ‘ Between nine and ten last night <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> , on duty near Waterloo Bridge , heard a cry for help and a splash in the water .
The night , however , was extremely dark and <unk> , so that , in spite of the help of several passers-by , it was quite impossible to effect a <unk> .
The alarm , however , was given , and , by the aid of the <unk> , the body was eventually recovered .
It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name , as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket , was John Openshaw , and whose residence is near Horsham .
It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station , and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small <unk> for river <unk> .
The body <unk> no traces of violence , and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident , which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside <unk> . ’ ” We sat in silence for some minutes , Holmes more <unk> and shaken than I had ever seen him .
“ That hurts my pride , Watson , ” he said at last .
“ It is a petty feeling , no doubt , but it hurts my pride .
It becomes a personal matter with me now , and , if God <unk> me health , I shall set my hand upon this gang .
That he should come to me for help , and that I should send him away to his death — ! ” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation , with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous <unk> and <unk> of his long thin hands .
“ They must be cunning <unk> , ” he exclaimed at last .
“ How could they have decoyed him down there ?
The <unk> is not on the direct line to the station .
The bridge , no doubt , was too crowded , even on such a night , for their purpose .
Well , Watson , we shall see who will <unk> in the long run .
I am going out now ! ” “ To the police ? ” “ No ; I shall be my own police .
When I have <unk> the web they may take the <unk> , but not before . ” All day I was engaged in my professional work , and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street .
Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet .
It was nearly ten o ’ clock before he entered , looking pale and worn .
He walked up to the sideboard , and tearing a piece from the <unk> he <unk> it <unk> , <unk> it down with a long draught of water .
“ You are hungry , ” I remarked .
“ <unk> .
It had escaped my memory .
I have had nothing since breakfast . ” “ Nothing ? ” “ Not a bite .
I had no time to think of it . ” “ And how have you succeeded ? ” “ Well . ” “ You have a clue ? ” “ I have them in the hollow of my hand .
Young Openshaw shall not long remain <unk> .
Why , Watson , let us put their own <unk> <unk> upon them .
It is well thought of ! ” “ What do you mean ? ” He took an orange from the cupboard , and tearing it to <unk> he <unk> out the pips upon the table .
Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope .
On the inside of the flap he wrote “ S.
H. for <unk> <unk> ” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “ Captain James Calhoun , <unk> _ Lone Star _ , Savannah , Georgia . ” “ That will <unk> him when he <unk> port , ” said he , <unk> .
“ It may give him a <unk> night .
He will find it as sure a <unk> of his fate as Openshaw did before him . ” “ And who is this Captain Calhoun ? ” “ The <unk> of the gang .
I shall have the others , but he first . ” “ How did you trace it , then ? ” He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket , all covered with dates and names .
“ I have spent the whole day , ” said he , “ over <unk> ’ s <unk> and files of the old papers , following the future <unk> of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’ 83 .
There were thirty-six <unk> of fair <unk> which were reported there during those months .
Of these , one , the _ Lone Star _ , instantly attracted my attention , since , although it was reported as having cleared from London , the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union . ” “ <unk> , I think . ” “ I was not and am not sure which ; but I knew that the ship must have an American <unk> . ” “ What then ? ” “ I searched the Dundee records , and when I found that the barque _ Lone Star _ was there in January , ’ 85 , my suspicion became a certainty .
I then inquired as to the <unk> which lay at present in the port of London . ” “ Yes ? ” “ The _ Lone Star _ had arrived here last week .
I went down to the Albert <unk> and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning , homeward bound to Savannah .
I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago , and as the wind is <unk> I have no doubt that she is now past the <unk> and not very far from the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ What will you do , then ? ” “ Oh , I have my hand upon him .
He and the two <unk> , are as I learn , the only <unk> <unk> in the ship .
The others are <unk> and <unk> .
I know , also , that they were all three away from the ship last night .
I had it from the <unk> who has been <unk> their <unk> .
By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter , and the <unk> will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder . ” There is ever a flaw , however , in the best laid of human plans , and the <unk> of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another , as cunning and as resolute as themselves , was upon their track .
Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year .
We waited long for news of the _ Lone Star _ of Savannah , but none ever reached us .
We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered <unk> of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave , with the letters “ <unk>
S. ” <unk> upon it , and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _ Lone Star _ .
VI .
THE <unk> WITH THE <unk> <unk> Isa Whitney , brother of the late Elias Whitney , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of St. George ’ s , was much <unk> to opium .
The habit grew upon him , as I understand , from some foolish <unk> when he was at <unk> ; for having read <unk> <unk> ’ s description of his dreams and <unk> , he had drenched his tobacco with <unk> in an attempt to produce the same effects .
He found , as so many more have done , that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of , and for many years he continued to be a <unk> to the drug , an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives .
I can see him now , with yellow , <unk> face , drooping lids , and <unk> <unk> , all huddled in a chair , the wreck and ruin of a noble man .
One night — it was in June , ’ 89 — there came a ring to my bell , about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock .
I sat up in my chair , and my wife laid her <unk> down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment .
“ A patient ! ” said she .
“ You ’ ll have to go out . ” I groaned , for I was newly come back from a weary day .
We heard the door open , a few hurried words , and then quick steps upon the <unk> .
Our own door flew open , and a lady , clad in some <unk> <unk> , with a black veil , entered the room .
“ You will excuse my calling so late , ” she began , and then , suddenly losing her self-control , she ran forward , threw her arms about my wife ’ s neck , and sobbed upon her shoulder .
“ Oh , I ’ m in such trouble ! ” she cried ; “ I do so want a little help . ” “ Why , ” said my wife , pulling up her veil , “ it is Kate Whitney .
How you startled me , Kate !
I had not an idea who you were when you came in . ” “ I didn ’ t know what to do , so I came straight to you . ” That was always the way .
<unk> who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a <unk> .
“ It was very sweet of you to come .
Now , you must have some <unk> and water , and sit here <unk> and tell us all about it .
Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed ? ” “ Oh , no , no !
I want the doctor ’ s advice and help , too .
It ’ s about Isa .
He has not been home for two days .
I am so frightened about him ! ” It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband ’ s trouble , to me as a doctor , to my wife as an old friend and school companion .
We <unk> and <unk> her by such words as we could find .
Did she know where her husband was ?
Was it possible that we could bring him back to her ?
It seems that it was .
She had the <unk> information that of late he had , when the fit was on him , made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City .
<unk> his <unk> had always been confined to one day , and he had come back , <unk> and shattered , in the evening .
But now the <unk> had been upon him <unk> hours , and he lay there , doubtless among the <unk> of the <unk> , breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects .
There he was to be found , she was sure of it , at the <unk> of <unk> , in Upper Swandam Lane .
But what was she to do ?
How could she , a young and timid woman , make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the <unk> who surrounded him ?
There was the case , and of course there was but one way out of it .
Might I not escort her to this place ?
And then , as a second thought , why should she come at all ?
I was Isa Whitney ’ s medical adviser , and as such I had influence over him .
I could manage it better if I were alone .
I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me .
And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me , and was <unk> <unk> in a hansom on a strange errand , as it seemed to me at the time , though the future only could show how strange it was to be .
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure .
Upper Swandam Lane is a vile <unk> <unk> behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge .
Between a <unk> and a <unk> , approached by a <unk> flight of steps leading down to a black <unk> like the mouth of a <unk> , I found the den of which I was in search .
<unk> my cab to wait , I passed down the steps , worn hollow in the centre by the <unk> tread of drunken feet ; and by the light of a <unk> oil-lamp above the door I found the <unk> and made my way into a long , low room , thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke , and <unk> with wooden berths , like the <unk> of an <unk> ship .
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic <unk> , bowed shoulders , bent knees , heads thrown back , and <unk> pointing upward , with here and there a dark , <unk> eye turned upon the newcomer .
Out of the black <unk> there glimmered little red circles of light , now bright , now faint , as the burning poison <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> of the metal pipes .
The most lay silent , but some muttered to themselves , and others talked together in a strange , low , monotonous voice , their conversation coming in <unk> , and then suddenly <unk> off into silence , each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little <unk> to the words of his <unk> .
At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal , beside which on a <unk> wooden <unk> there sat a tall , thin old man , with his jaw <unk> upon his two fists , and his elbows upon his knees , staring into the fire .
As I entered , a sallow <unk> attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug , beckoning me to an empty <unk> .
“ Thank you .
I have not come to stay , ” said I.
“ There is a friend of mine here , Mr. Isa Whitney , and I wish to speak with him . ” There was a movement and an exclamation from my right , and peering through the gloom , I saw Whitney , pale , haggard , and <unk> , staring out at me .
“ My God !
It ’ s Watson , ” said he .
He was in a pitiable state of reaction , with every nerve in a <unk> .
“ I say , Watson , what o ’ clock is it ? ” “ Nearly eleven . ” “ Of what day ? ” “ Of Friday , June <unk> . ” “ Good heavens !
I thought it was Wednesday .
It is Wednesday .
What d ’ you want to frighten a chap for ? ” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key .
“ I tell you that it is Friday , man .
Your wife has been waiting this two days for you .
You should be ashamed of yourself ! ” “ So I am .
But you ’ ve got mixed , Watson , for I have only been here a few hours , three pipes , four pipes — I forget how many .
But I ’ ll go home with you .
I wouldn ’ t frighten Kate — poor little Kate .
Give me your hand !
Have you a cab ? ” “ Yes , I have one waiting . ” “ Then I shall go in it .
But I must owe something .
<unk> what I owe , Watson .
I am all off colour .
I can do nothing for myself . ” I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers , holding my breath to keep out the vile , <unk> <unk> of the drug , and looking about for the manager .
As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt , and a low voice whispered , “ <unk> past me , and then look back at me . ” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear .
I glanced down .
They could only have come from the old man at my side , and yet he sat now as <unk> as ever , very thin , very wrinkled , bent with age , an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees , as though it had dropped in sheer <unk> from his fingers .
I took two steps forward and looked back .
It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment .
He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.
His form had filled out , his wrinkles were gone , the dull eyes had regained their fire , and there , sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise , was none other than Sherlock Holmes .
He made a slight motion to me to approach him , and instantly , as he turned his face half round to the company once more , <unk> into a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
“ Holmes ! ” I whispered , “ what on earth are you doing in this den ? ” “ As low as you can , ” he answered ; “ I have excellent ears .
If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that <unk> friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you . ” “ I have a cab outside . ” “ Then pray send him home in it .
You may safely trust him , for he appears to be too limp to get into any <unk> .
I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me .
If you will wait outside , I shall be with you in five minutes . ” It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes ’ <unk> , for they were always so exceedingly definite , and put forward with such a quiet air of <unk> .
I felt , however , that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished ; and for the rest , I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the <unk> condition of his existence .
In a few minutes I had written my note , paid Whitney ’ s bill , led him out to the cab , and seen him driven through the darkness .
In a very short time a <unk> figure had emerged from the opium den , and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes .
For two streets he <unk> along with a bent back and an uncertain foot .
Then , glancing quickly round , he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter .
“ I suppose , Watson , ” said he , “ that you imagine that I have added <unk> to cocaine <unk> , and all the other little <unk> on which you have favoured me with your medical views . ” “ I was certainly surprised to find you there . ” “ But not more so than I to find you . ” “ I came to find a friend . ” “ And I to find an enemy . ” “ An enemy ? ” “ Yes ; one of my natural enemies , or , shall I say , my natural prey .
<unk> , Watson , I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry , and I have hoped to find a clue in the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> , as I have done before now .
Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour ’ s <unk> ; for I have used it before now for my own purposes , and the <unk> Lascar who runs it has sworn to have <unk> upon me .
There is a <unk> at the back of that building , near the corner of Paul ’ s <unk> , which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the <unk> nights . ” “ What !
You do not mean bodies ? ” “ <unk> , bodies , Watson .
We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den .
It is the vilest <unk> on the whole riverside , and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more .
But our trap should be here . ” He put his two <unk> between his teeth and whistled <unk> — a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance , followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses ’ hoofs .
“ Now , Watson , ” said Holmes , as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom , throwing out two golden <unk> of yellow light from its side <unk> .
“ You ’ ll come with me , won ’ t you ? ” “ If I can be of use . ” “ Oh , a trusty <unk> is always of use ; and a <unk> still more so .
My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one . ” “ The Cedars ? ” “ Yes ; that is Mr. St. Clair ’ s house .
I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry . ” “ Where is it , then ? ” “ Near Lee , in Kent .
We have a <unk> drive before us . ” “ But I am all in the dark . ” “ Of course you are .
You ’ ll know all about it presently .
Jump up here .
All right , John ; we shall not need you .
Here ’ s half a crown .
Look out for me to-morrow , about eleven .
Give her her head .
So long , then ! ” He <unk> the horse with his whip , and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets , which widened gradually , until we were flying across a broad <unk> bridge , with the <unk> river flowing <unk> beneath us .
Beyond lay another dull <unk> of bricks and <unk> , its silence broken only by the heavy , regular footfall of the policeman , or the <unk> and <unk> of some <unk> party of <unk> .
A dull <unk> was drifting slowly across the sky , and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the <unk> of the clouds .
Holmes drove in silence , with his head sunk upon his breast , and the air of a man who is lost in thought , while I sat beside him , curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so <unk> , and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts .
We had driven several miles , and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of <unk> villas , when he shook himself , shrugged his shoulders , and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best .
“ You have a <unk> <unk> of silence , Watson , ” said he .
“ It makes you quite invaluable as a companion .
’ Pon my word , it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to , for my own thoughts are not <unk> .
I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she <unk> me at the door . ” “ You forget that I know nothing about it . ” “ I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee .
It seems absurdly simple , and yet , <unk> I can get nothing to go upon .
There ’ s plenty of <unk> , no doubt , but I can ’ t get the end of it into my hand .
Now , I ’ ll state the case clearly and <unk> to you , Watson , and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me . ” “ <unk> , then . ” “ Some years ago — to be definite , in May , <unk> — there came to Lee a gentleman , Neville St. Clair by name , who appeared to have plenty of money .
He took a large villa , laid out the grounds very nicely , and lived generally in good style .
By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood , and in <unk> he married the daughter of a local <unk> , by whom he now has two children .
He had no occupation , but was interested in several <unk> and went into town as a rule in the morning , returning by the 5 : <unk> from <unk> Street every night .
Mr. St. Clair is now <unk> years of age , is a man of <unk> habits , a good husband , a very affectionate father , and a man who is popular with all who know him .
I may add that his whole debts at the present moment , as far as we have been able to <unk> , amount to £ <unk> 10 _ s _ . , while he has £ <unk> standing to his credit in the Capital and <unk> Bank .
There is no reason , therefore , to think that money troubles have been <unk> upon his mind .
“ Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather <unk> than usual , remarking before he started that he had two important <unk> to perform , and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks .
Now , by the merest chance , his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday , very shortly after his departure , to the effect that a small <unk> of considerable value which she had been <unk> was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen <unk> Company .
Now , if you are well up in your London , you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street , which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane , where you found me to-night .
Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch , started for the City , did some <unk> , proceeded to the company ’ s office , got her packet , and found herself at exactly 4 : <unk> walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station .
Have you followed me so far ? ” “ It is very clear . ” “ If you remember , Monday was an exceedingly hot day , and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly , glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab , as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself .
While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane , she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry , and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and , as it seemed to her , beckoning to her from a <unk> window .
The window was open , and she distinctly saw his face , which she <unk> as being terribly agitated .
He waved his hands frantically to her , and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some <unk> force from behind .
One singular point which struck her quick <unk> eye was that although he wore some dark coat , such as he had started to town in , he had on neither collar nor <unk> .
“ <unk> that something was amiss with him , she rushed down the steps — for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night — and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor .
At the foot of the stairs , however , she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken , who thrust her back and , <unk> by a <unk> , who <unk> as assistant there , pushed her out into the street .
<unk> with the most maddening doubts and fears , she rushed down the lane and , by rare good-fortune , met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector , all on their way to their beat .
The inspector and two men <unk> her back , and in spite of the continued <unk> of the proprietor , they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen .
There was no sign of him there .
In fact , in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a <unk> <unk> of hideous aspect , who , it seems , made his home there .
Both he and the Lascar <unk> swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon .
So determined was their <unk> that the inspector was staggered , and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been <unk> when , with a cry , she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it .
Out there fell a <unk> of children ’ s bricks .
It was the toy which he had promised to bring home .
“ This discovery , and the evident confusion which the cripple showed , made the inspector realise that the matter was serious .
The rooms were carefully examined , and results all pointed to an <unk> crime .
The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom , which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves .
Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow <unk> , which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water .
The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below .
On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the <unk> , and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom .
<unk> away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair , with the exception of his coat .
His boots , his <unk> , his hat , and his watch — all were there .
There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments , and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair .
Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other <unk> could be discovered , and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by <unk> , for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy .
“ And now as to the <unk> who seemed to be immediately <unk> in the matter .
The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest <unk> , but as , by Mrs. St. Clair ’ s story , he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband ’ s appearance at the window , he could hardly have been more than an <unk> to the crime .
His <unk> was one of absolute ignorance , and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone , his lodger , and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman ’ s clothes .
“ So much for the Lascar manager .
Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den , and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair .
His name is Hugh Boone , and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City .
He is a professional beggar , though in order to avoid the police <unk> he <unk> to a small trade in wax <unk> .
Some little distance down Threadneedle Street , upon the left-hand side , there is , as you may have remarked , a small angle in the wall .
Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat , cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap , and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of <unk> <unk> into the <unk> leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him .
I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance , and I have been surprised at the <unk> which he has <unk> in a short time .
His appearance , you see , is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him .
A shock of orange hair , a pale face <unk> by a horrible scar , which , by its contraction , has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip , a bulldog chin , and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes , which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair , all mark him out from amid the common crowd of <unk> and so , too , does his wit , for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of <unk> which may be thrown at him by the passers-by .
This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den , and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest . ” “ But a cripple ! ” said I.
“ What could he have done <unk> against a man in the <unk> of life ? ” “ He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp ; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and <unk> man .
Surely your medical experience would tell you , Watson , that <unk> in one limb is often <unk> for by exceptional strength in the others . ” “ Pray continue your narrative . ” “ Mrs.
St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window , and she was escorted home in a cab by the police , as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations .
Inspector <unk> , who had charge of the case , made a very careful examination of the premises , but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter .
One mistake had been made in not <unk> Boone instantly , as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar , but this fault was soon <unk> , and he was seized and searched , without anything being found which could <unk> him .
There were , it is true , some <unk> upon his right <unk> , but he pointed to his <unk> , which had been cut near the <unk> , and explained that the bleeding came from there , <unk> that he had been to the window not long before , and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source .
He denied <unk> having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police .
As to Mrs. St. Clair ’ s <unk> that she had actually seen her husband at the window , he declared that she must have been either mad or <unk> .
He was removed , loudly <unk> , to the police-station , while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the <unk> tide might afford some fresh clue .
“ And it did , though they hardly found upon the <unk> what they had feared to find .
It was Neville St. Clair ’ s coat , and not Neville St. Clair , which lay <unk> as the tide <unk> .
And what do you think they found in the pockets ? ” “ I cannot imagine . ” “ No , I don ’ t think you would guess .
Every pocket <unk> with pennies and half-pennies — <unk> pennies and <unk> half-pennies .
It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide .
But a human body is a different matter .
There is a fierce <unk> between the wharf and the house .
It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the <unk> body had been <unk> away into the river . ” “ But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room .
Would the body be dressed in a coat alone ? ” “ No , sir , but the facts might be met <unk> enough .
<unk> that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window , there is no human eye which could have seen the deed .
What would he do then ?
It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the <unk> garments .
He would <unk> the coat , then , and be in the act of throwing it out , when it would occur to him that it would <unk> and not sink .
He has little time , for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up , and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street .
There is not an instant to be lost .
He <unk> to some secret <unk> , where he has <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> , and he <unk> all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat ’ s sinking .
He throws it out , and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below , and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared . ” “ It certainly sounds feasible . ” “ Well , we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better .
Boone , as I have told you , was arrested and taken to the station , but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him .
He had for years been known as a professional beggar , but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one .
There the matter stands at present , and the questions which have to be solved — what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den , what happened to him when there , where is he now , and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance — are all as far from a solution as ever .
I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties . ” While Sherlock Holmes had been <unk> this singular series of events , we had been <unk> through the outskirts of the great town until the last <unk> houses had been left behind , and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us .
Just as he finished , however , we drove through two scattered villages , where a few lights still glimmered in the windows .
“ We are on the outskirts of Lee , ” said my companion .
“ We have touched on three English <unk> in our short drive , starting in <unk> , passing over an angle of Surrey , and ending in Kent .
See that light among the trees ?
That is The Cedars , and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already , I have little doubt , caught the clink of our horse ’ s feet . ” “ But why are you not <unk> the case from Baker Street ? ” I asked .
“ Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here .
Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal , and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a <unk> for my friend and colleague .
I <unk> to meet her , Watson , when I have no news of her husband .
Here we are .
<unk> , there , <unk> ! ” We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds .
A stable-boy had run out to the horse ’ s head , and springing down , I followed Holmes up the small , winding gravel-drive which led to the house .
As we approached , the door flew open , and a little <unk> woman stood in the opening , clad in some sort of light <unk> de <unk> , with a touch of fluffy pink <unk> at her neck and wrists .
She stood with her figure outlined against the <unk> of light , one hand upon the door , one <unk> in her eagerness , her body slightly bent , her head and face protruded , with eager eyes and parted lips , a standing question .
“ Well ? ” she cried , “ well ? ” And then , seeing that there were two of us , she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders .
“ No good news ? ” “ None . ” “ No bad ? ” “ No . ” “ Thank God for that .
But come in .
You must be weary , for you have had a long day . ” “ This is my friend , Dr. Watson .
He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases , and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation . ” “ I am delighted to see you , ” said she , pressing my hand warmly .
“ You will , I am sure , forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements , when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us . ” “ My dear madam , ” said I , “ I am an old <unk> , and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed .
If I can be of any assistance , either to you or to my friend here , I shall be indeed happy . ” “ Now , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , ” said the lady as we entered a <unk> dining-room , upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out , “ I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions , to which I beg that you will give a plain answer . ” “ Certainly , madam . ” “ Do not trouble about my <unk> .
I am not hysterical , nor given to fainting .
I simply wish to hear your real , real opinion . ” “ Upon what point ? ” “ In your heart of hearts , do you think that Neville is alive ? ” Sherlock Holmes seemed to be <unk> by the question .
“ Frankly , now ! ” she repeated , standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair .
“ Frankly , then , madam , I do not . ” “ You think that he is dead ? ” “ I do . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ I don ’ t say that .
Perhaps . ” “ And on what day did he meet his death ? ” “ On Monday . ” “ Then perhaps , Mr. Holmes , you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day . ” Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been <unk> .
“ What ! ” he roared .
“ Yes , to-day . ” She stood smiling , holding up a little slip of paper in the air .
“ May I see it ? ” “ Certainly . ” He snatched it from her in his eagerness , and <unk> it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it <unk> .
I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder .
The envelope was a very coarse one and was <unk> with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day , or rather of the day before , for it was considerably after midnight .
“ <unk> writing , ” murmured Holmes .
“ Surely this is not your husband ’ s writing , madam . ” “ No , but the enclosure is . ” “ I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address . ” “ How can you tell that ? ” “ The name , you see , is in perfectly black ink , which has dried itself .
The rest is of the greyish colour , which shows that blotting-paper has been used .
If it had been written straight off , and then <unk> , none would be of a deep black shade .
This man has written the name , and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address , which can only mean that he was not familiar with it .
It is , of course , a trifle , but there is nothing so important as trifles .
Let us now see the letter .
Ha !
there has been an enclosure here ! ” “ Yes , there was a ring .
His <unk> . ” “ And you are sure that this is your husband ’ s hand ? ” “ One of his hands . ” “ One ? ” “ His hand when he wrote hurriedly .
It is very unlike his usual writing , and yet I know it well . ” “ ‘ <unk> do not be frightened .
All will come well .
There is a huge error which it may take some little time to <unk> .
Wait in patience . — <unk> . ’ <unk> in pencil upon the <unk> of a book , <unk> size , no <unk> .
Hum !
<unk> to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb .
Ha !
And the flap has been <unk> , if I am not very much in error , by a person who had been <unk> tobacco .
And you have no doubt that it is your husband ’ s hand , madam ? ” “ None .
Neville wrote those words . ” “ And they were posted to-day at Gravesend .
Well , Mrs. St. Clair , the clouds <unk> , though I should not venture to say that the danger is over . ” “ But he must be alive , Mr. Holmes . ” “ Unless this is a clever <unk> to put us on the wrong scent .
The ring , after all , proves nothing .
It may have been taken from him . ” “ No , no ; it is , it is his very own writing ! ” “ Very well .
It may , however , have been written on Monday and only posted to-day . ” “ That is possible . ” “ If so , much may have happened between . ” “ Oh , you must not <unk> me , Mr. Holmes .
I know that all is well with him .
There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him .
On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom , and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened .
Do you think that I would <unk> to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death ? ” “ I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner .
And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to <unk> your view .
But if your husband is alive and able to write letters , why should he remain away from you ? ” “ I cannot imagine .
It is <unk> . ” “ And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you ? ” “ No . ” “ And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane ? ” “ Very much so . ” “ Was the window open ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then he might have called to you ? ” “ He might . ” “ He only , as I understand , gave an <unk> cry ? ” “ Yes . ” “ A call for help , you thought ? ” “ Yes .
He waved his hands . ” “ But it might have been a cry of surprise .
<unk> at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands ? ” “ It is possible . ” “ And you thought he was pulled back ? ” “ He disappeared so suddenly . ” “ He might have <unk> back .
You did not see anyone else in the room ? ” “ No , but this horrible man confessed to having been there , and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs . ” “ Quite so .
Your husband , as far as you could see , had his ordinary clothes on ? ” “ But without his collar or tie .
I distinctly saw his bare throat . ” “ Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane ? ” “ Never . ” “ Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium ? ” “ Never . ” “ Thank you , Mrs. St. Clair .
Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear .
We shall now have a little supper and then retire , for we may have a very busy day to-morrow . ” A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal , and I was quickly between the sheets , for I was weary after my night of adventure .
Sherlock Holmes was a man , however , who , when he had an <unk> problem upon his mind , would go for days , and even for a week , without rest , turning it over , rearranging his facts , looking at it from every point of view until he had either <unk> it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient .
It was soon evident to me that he was now <unk> for an all-night sitting .
He took off his coat and waistcoat , put on a large blue dressing-gown , and then wandered about the room <unk> pillows from his bed and <unk> from the sofa and <unk> .
With these he <unk> a sort of Eastern <unk> , upon which he perched himself cross-legged , with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him .
In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there , an old <unk> pipe between his lips , his eyes fixed <unk> upon the corner of the ceiling , the blue smoke curling up from him , silent , <unk> , with the light shining upon his <unk> aquiline features .
So he sat as I dropped off to sleep , and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up , and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment .
The pipe was still between his lips , the smoke still curled upward , and the room was full of a dense tobacco <unk> , but nothing remained of the <unk> of shag which I had seen upon the previous night .
“ <unk> , Watson ? ” he asked .
“ Yes . ” “ <unk> for a morning drive ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ Then dress .
No one is stirring yet , but I know where the stable-boy sleeps , and we shall soon have the trap out . ” He chuckled to himself as he spoke , his eyes twinkled , and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night .
As I dressed I glanced at my watch .
It was no wonder that no one was stirring .
It was twenty-five minutes past four .
I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse .
“ I want to test a little theory of mine , ” said he , pulling on his boots .
“ I think , Watson , that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute <unk> in Europe .
I <unk> to be <unk> from here to Charing Cross .
But I think I have the key of the affair now . ” “ And where is it ? ” I asked , smiling .
“ In the <unk> , ” he answered .
“ Oh , yes , I am not joking , ” he continued , seeing my look of incredulity .
“ I have just been there , and I have taken it out , and I have got it in this Gladstone bag .
Come on , my boy , and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock . ” We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible , and out into the bright morning <unk> .
In the road stood our horse and trap , with the <unk> stable-boy waiting at the head .
We both sprang in , and away we dashed down the London Road .
A few country <unk> were stirring , bearing in vegetables to the metropolis , but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and <unk> as some city in a dream .
“ It has been in some points a singular case , ” said Holmes , <unk> the horse on into a <unk> .
“ I confess that I have been as blind as a mole , but it is better to learn <unk> late than never to learn it at all . ” In town the <unk> <unk> were just beginning to look <unk> from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side .
<unk> down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river , and dashing up <unk> Street <unk> sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street .
Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force , and the two constables at the door <unk> him .
One of them held the horse ’ s head while the other led us in .
“ Who is on duty ? ” asked Holmes .
“ Inspector Bradstreet , sir . ” “ Ah , Bradstreet , how are you ? ” A tall , stout official had come down the <unk> passage , in a <unk> cap and <unk> jacket .
“ I wish to have a quiet word with you , Bradstreet . ” “ Certainly , Mr. Holmes .
<unk> into my room here . ” It was a small , <unk> room , with a huge ledger upon the table , and a <unk> projecting from the wall .
The inspector sat down at his desk .
“ What can I do for you , Mr. Holmes ? ” “ I called about that <unk> , Boone — the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair , of Lee . ” “ Yes .
He was brought up and <unk> for further inquiries . ” “ So I heard .
You have him here ? ” “ In the cells . ” “ Is he quiet ? ” “ Oh , he gives no trouble .
But he is a dirty scoundrel . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ Yes , it is all we can do to make him wash his hands , and his face is as black as a <unk> ’ s .
Well , when once his case has been settled , he will have a regular prison <unk> ; and I think , if you saw him , you would agree with me that he needed it . ” “ I should like to see him very much . ” “ Would you ?
That is easily done .
Come this way .
You can leave your bag . ” “ No , I think that I ’ ll take it . ” “ Very good .
Come this way , if you please . ” He led us down a passage , opened a barred door , passed down a winding stair , and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side .
“ The third on the right is his , ” said the inspector .
“ Here it is ! ” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through .
“ He is asleep , ” said he .
“ You can see him very well . ” We both put our eyes to the grating .
The prisoner lay with his face towards us , in a very deep sleep , breathing slowly and heavily .
He was a middle-sized man , <unk> clad as became his calling , with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat .
He was , as the inspector had said , extremely dirty , but the <unk> which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive <unk> .
A broad <unk> from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin , and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip , so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl .
A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead .
“ He ’ s a beauty , isn ’ t he ? ” said the inspector .
“ He certainly needs a wash , ” remarked Holmes .
“ I had an idea that he might , and I took the liberty of bringing the <unk> with me . ” He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke , and took out , to my astonishment , a very large <unk> .
“ He !
he !
You are a funny one , ” chuckled the inspector .
“ Now , if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly , we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure . ” “ Well , I don ’ t know why not , ” said the inspector .
“ He <unk> ’ t look a credit to the Bow Street cells , does he ? ” He slipped his key into the lock , and we all very quietly entered the cell .
The sleeper half turned , and then settled down once more into a deep <unk> .
Holmes stooped to the <unk> , <unk> his sponge , and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner ’ s face .
“ Let me introduce you , ” he shouted , “ to Mr. Neville St. Clair , of Lee , in the county of Kent . ” Never in my life have I seen such a sight .
The man ’ s face <unk> off under the sponge like the bark from a tree .
Gone was the coarse brown tint !
Gone , too , was the horrid scar which had <unk> it across , and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face !
A <unk> brought away the tangled red hair , and there , sitting up in his bed , was a pale , sad-faced , <unk> man , <unk> and <unk> , rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment .
Then suddenly realising the exposure , he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow .
“ Great heavens ! ” cried the inspector , “ it is , indeed , the missing man .
I know him from the photograph . ” The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who <unk> himself to his destiny .
“ Be it so , ” said he .
“ And pray what am I charged with ? ” “ With making away with Mr. Neville St. — Oh , come , you can ’ t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it , ” said the inspector with a grin .
“ Well , I have been <unk> years in the force , but this really takes the <unk> . ” “ If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair , then it is obvious that no crime has been committed , and that , therefore , I am <unk> <unk> . ” “ No crime , but a very great error has been committed , ” said Holmes .
“ You would have done better to have trusted your wife . ” “ It was not the wife ; it was the children , ” groaned the prisoner .
“ God help me , I would not have them ashamed of their father .
My God !
What an exposure !
What can I do ? ” Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder .
“ If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up , ” said he , “ of course you can hardly avoid publicity .
On the other hand , if you <unk> the police authorities that there is no possible case against you , I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers .
Inspector Bradstreet would , I am sure , make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the <unk> authorities .
The case would then never go into court at all . ” “ God bless you ! ” cried the prisoner passionately .
“ I would have <unk> imprisonment , <unk> , even <unk> , rather than have left my miserable secret as a family <unk> to my children .
“ You are the first who have ever heard my story .
My father was a schoolmaster in <unk> , where I received an excellent education .
I travelled in my youth , took to the stage , and finally became a <unk> on an evening paper in London .
One day my <unk> wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis , and I <unk> to supply them .
There was the point from which all my adventures started .
It was only by trying begging as an <unk> that I could get the facts upon which to <unk> my articles .
When an actor I had , of course , learned all the <unk> of making up , and had been famous in the <unk> for my skill .
I took advantage now of my <unk> .
I <unk> my face , and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster .
Then with a red head of hair , and an <unk> dress , I took my station in the business part of the city , <unk> as a <unk> but really as a beggar .
For seven hours I <unk> my trade , and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26 _ s _ .
4 _ d _ .
“ I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until , some time later , I <unk> a bill for a friend and had a <unk> served upon me for £ <unk> .
I was at my wit ’ s end where to get the money , but a sudden idea came to me .
I begged a fortnight ’ s grace from the <unk> , asked for a holiday from my employers , and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise .
In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt .
“ Well , you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to <unk> work at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint , laying my cap on the ground , and sitting still .
It was a long fight between my pride and the money , but the <unk> won at last , and I threw up <unk> and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen , <unk> pity by my ghastly face and <unk> my pockets with coppers .
Only one man knew my secret .
He was the <unk> of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane , where I could every morning emerge as a <unk> beggar and in the evenings <unk> myself into a well-dressed man about town .
This fellow , a Lascar , was well paid by me for his rooms , so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession .
“ Well , very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money .
I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ <unk> a year — which is less than my average takings — but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up , and also in a facility of <unk> , which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City .
All day a stream of pennies , varied by silver , poured in upon me , and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £ 2 .
“ As I grew richer I grew more <unk> , took a house in the country , and eventually married , without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation .
My dear wife knew that I had business in the City .
She little knew what .
“ Last Monday I had finished for the day and was <unk> in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw , to my horror and astonishment , that my wife was standing in the street , with her eyes fixed full upon me .
I gave a cry of surprise , threw up my arms to cover my face , and , rushing to my confidant , the Lascar , <unk> him to prevent anyone from coming up to me .
I heard her voice downstairs , but I knew that she could not ascend .
Swiftly I threw off my clothes , pulled on those of a beggar , and put on my <unk> and <unk> .
Even a wife ’ s eyes could not <unk> so complete a disguise .
But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room , and that the clothes might <unk> me .
I threw open the window , <unk> by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning .
Then I seized my coat , which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings .
I hurled it out of the window , and it disappeared into the <unk> .
The other clothes would have followed , but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair , and a few minutes after I found , rather , I confess , to my relief , that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair , I was arrested as his murderer .
“ I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain .
I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible , and hence my <unk> for a dirty face .
<unk> that my wife would be terribly anxious , I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me , together with a hurried <unk> , telling her that she had no cause to fear . ” “ That note only reached her yesterday , ” said Holmes .
“ Good God !
What a week she must have spent ! ” “ The police have watched this Lascar , ” said Inspector Bradstreet , “ and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter <unk> .
<unk> he handed it to some <unk> <unk> of his , who forgot all about it for some days . ” “ That was it , ” said Holmes , nodding <unk> ; “ I have no doubt of it .
But have you never been <unk> for begging ? ” “ Many times ; but what was a fine to me ? ” “ It must stop here , however , ” said Bradstreet .
“ If the police are to hush this thing up , there must be no more of Hugh Boone . ” “ I have sworn it by the most solemn <unk> which a man can take . ” “ In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken .
But if you are found again , then all must come out .
I am sure , Mr. Holmes , that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up .
I wish I knew how you reach your results . ” “ I reached this one , ” said my friend , “ by sitting upon five pillows and <unk> an ounce of shag .
I think , Watson , that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast . ” VII .
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> <unk> I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas , with the intention of <unk> him the <unk> of the season .
He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown , a <unk> within his reach upon the right , and a pile of crumpled morning papers , evidently newly studied , near at hand .
Beside the couch was a wooden chair , and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable <unk> hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places .
A lens and a <unk> lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been <unk> in this manner for the purpose of examination .
“ You are engaged , ” said I ; “ perhaps I <unk> you . ” “ Not at all .
I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results .
The matter is a perfectly trivial one ” — he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat — “ but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of <unk> . ” I seated myself in his armchair and <unk> my hands before his crackling fire , for a sharp frost had set in , and the windows were thick with the <unk> <unk> .
“ I suppose , ” I remarked , “ that , homely as it looks , this thing has some deadly story linked on to it — that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime . ” “ No , no .
No crime , ” said Sherlock Holmes , laughing .
“ Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four <unk> human <unk> all <unk> each other within the <unk> of a few square miles .
<unk> the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of <unk> , every possible <unk> of events may be expected to take place , and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal .
We have already had experience of such . ” “ So much so , ” I remarked , “ that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes , three have been entirely free of any legal crime . ” “ Precisely .
You <unk> to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers , to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland , and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip .
Well , I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent <unk> .
You know Peterson , the commissionaire ? ” “ Yes . ” “ It is to him that this <unk> belongs . ” “ It is his hat . ” “ No , no , he found it .
Its owner is unknown .
I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered <unk> but as an intellectual problem .
And , first , as to how it came here .
It arrived upon Christmas morning , in company with a good fat goose , which is , I have no doubt , <unk> at this moment in front of Peterson ’ s fire .
The facts are these : about four o ’ clock on Christmas morning , Peterson , who , as you know , is a very <unk> fellow , was returning from some small <unk> and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road .
In front of him he saw , in the <unk> , a <unk> man , walking with a slight <unk> , and carrying a white goose <unk> over his shoulder .
As he reached the corner of Goodge Street , a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs .
One of the latter knocked off the man ’ s hat , on which he raised his stick to <unk> himself and , swinging it over his head , <unk> the shop window behind him .
Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his <unk> ; but the man , shocked at having broken the window , and seeing an <unk> person in uniform rushing towards him , dropped his goose , took to his heels , and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road .
The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson , so that he was left in possession of the field of <unk> , and also of the <unk> of <unk> in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose . ” “ Which surely he <unk> to their owner ? ” “ My dear fellow , there lies the problem .
It is true that ‘ For Mrs. Henry Baker ’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird ’ s left leg , and it is also true that the initials ‘ H.
B. ’ are <unk> upon the lining of this hat , but as there are some thousands of Bakers , and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of <unk> , it is not easy to <unk> lost property to any one of them . ” “ What , then , did Peterson do ? ” “ He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning , knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me .
The goose we retained until this morning , when there were signs that , in spite of the slight frost , it would be well that it should be <unk> without unnecessary delay .
Its <unk> has carried it off , therefore , to <unk> the <unk> destiny of a goose , while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner . ” “ Did he not advertise ? ” “ No . ” “ Then , what clue could you have as to his identity ? ” “ Only as much as we can deduce . ” “ From his hat ? ” “ Precisely . ” “ But you are joking .
What can you gather from this old battered felt ? ” “ Here is my lens .
You know my methods .
What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article ? ” I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully .
It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape , hard and much the worse for wear .
The lining had been of red silk , but was a good deal discoloured .
There was no maker ’ s name ; but , as Holmes had remarked , the initials “ H.
B. ” were scrawled upon one side .
It was pierced in the <unk> for a hat-securer , but the elastic was missing .
For the rest , it was cracked , exceedingly dusty , and spotted in several places , although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured <unk> by smearing them with ink .
“ I can see nothing , ” said I , <unk> it back to my friend .
“ On the contrary , Watson , you can see everything .
You fail , however , to reason from what you see .
You are too timid in drawing your inferences . ” “ Then , pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat ? ” He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him .
“ It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been , ” he remarked , “ and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct , and a few others which represent at least a strong <unk> of probability .
That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it , and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years , although he has now fallen upon evil days .
He had foresight , but has less now than formerly , pointing to a moral retrogression , which , when taken with the decline of his fortunes , seems to indicate some evil influence , probably drink , at work upon him .
This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him . ” “ My dear Holmes ! ” “ He has , however , retained some degree of self-respect , ” he continued , <unk> my <unk> .
“ He is a man who leads a <unk> life , goes out little , is out of training entirely , is middle-aged , has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days , and which he <unk> with lime-cream .
These are the more <unk> facts which are to be deduced from his hat .
<unk> , by the way , that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house . ” “ You are certainly joking , Holmes . ” “ Not in the least .
Is it possible that even now , when I give you these results , you are unable to see how they are <unk> ? ” “ I have no doubt that I am very <unk> , but I must confess that I am unable to follow you .
For example , how did you deduce that this man was intellectual ? ” For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head .
It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose .
“ It is a question of <unk> capacity , ” said he ; “ a man with so large a brain must have something in it . ” “ The decline of his fortunes , then ? ” “ This hat is three years old .
These flat <unk> curled at the edge came in then .
It is a hat of the very best <unk> .
Look at the band of <unk> silk and the excellent lining .
If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago , and has had no hat since , then he has <unk> gone down in the world . ” “ Well , that is clear enough , certainly .
But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression ? ” Sherlock Holmes laughed .
“ Here is the foresight , ” said he putting his finger upon the little <unk> and loop of the hat-securer .
“ They are never sold upon <unk> .
If this man ordered one , it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight , since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind .
But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it , it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly , which is a distinct proof of a <unk> nature .
On the other hand , he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by <unk> them with ink , which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect . ” “ Your reasoning is certainly <unk> . ” “ The further points , that he is middle-aged , that his hair is grizzled , that it has been recently cut , and that he uses lime-cream , are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining .
The lens <unk> a large number of <unk> , clean cut by the <unk> of the <unk> .
They all appear to be <unk> , and there is a distinct <unk> of lime-cream .
This dust , you will observe , is not the <unk> , grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house , showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time , while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the <unk> <unk> very freely , and could therefore , hardly be in the best of training . ” “ But his wife — you said that she had ceased to love him . ” “ This hat has not been brushed for weeks .
When I see you , my dear Watson , with a week ’ s <unk> of dust upon your hat , and when your wife <unk> you to go out in such a state , I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife ’ s affection . ” “ But he might be a bachelor . ” “ <unk> , he was bringing home the goose as a <unk> to his wife .
Remember the card upon the bird ’ s leg . ” “ You have an answer to everything .
But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house ? ” “ One tallow stain , or even two , might come by chance ; but when I see no less than five , I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow — walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a <unk> candle in the other .
Anyhow , he never got <unk> from a <unk> .
Are you satisfied ? ” “ Well , it is very ingenious , ” said I , laughing ; “ but since , as you said just now , there has been no crime committed , and no harm done save the loss of a goose , all this seems to be rather a waste of energy . ” Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply , when the door flew open , and Peterson , the commissionaire , rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment .
“ The goose , Mr. Holmes !
The goose , sir ! ” he gasped .
“ Eh ?
What of it , then ?
Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window ? ” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a <unk> view of the man ’ s excited face .
“ See here , sir !
See what my wife found in its crop ! ” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly <unk> blue stone , rather smaller than a <unk> in size , but of such <unk> and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand .
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle .
“ By Jove , Peterson ! ” said he , “ this is treasure <unk> indeed .
I suppose you know what you have got ? ” “ A <unk> , sir ?
A precious stone .
It cuts into glass as though it were putty . ” “ It ’ s more than a precious stone .
It is _ the _ precious stone . ” “ Not the Countess of Morcar ’ s blue carbuncle ! ” I ejaculated .
“ Precisely so .
I ought to know its size and shape , seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in _ The Times _ every day lately .
It is absolutely unique , and its value can only be conjectured , but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price . ” “ A thousand pounds !
Great Lord of mercy ! ” The commissionaire <unk> down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us .
“ That is the reward , and I have reason to know that there are <unk> <unk> in the <unk> which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem . ” “ It was lost , if I remember <unk> , at the Hotel Cosmopolitan , ” I remarked .
“ Precisely so , on December 22nd , just five days ago .
John Horner , a plumber , was accused of having abstracted it from the lady ’ s jewel-case .
The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes .
I have some account of the matter here , I believe . ” He rummaged amid his newspapers , glancing over the dates , until at last he <unk> one out , <unk> it over , and read the following paragraph : “ Hotel Cosmopolitan <unk> <unk> .
John Horner , 26 , plumber , was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst . , abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle .
James Ryder , <unk> at the hotel , gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might <unk> the second bar of the grate , which was loose .
He had remained with Horner some little time , but had finally been called away .
On returning , he found that Horner had disappeared , that the bureau had been forced open , and that the small morocco <unk> in which , as it afterwards transpired , the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel , was lying empty upon the dressing-table .
Ryder instantly gave the alarm , and Horner was arrested the same evening ; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms .
Catherine Cusack , maid to the Countess , <unk> to having heard Ryder ’ s cry of <unk> on discovering the robbery , and to having rushed into the room , where she found matters as described by the last witness .
Inspector Bradstreet , B division , gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner , who struggled frantically , and protested his innocence in the strongest terms .
<unk> of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner , the magistrate refused to deal <unk> with the <unk> , but referred it to the Assizes .
Horner , who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings , fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court . ” “ Hum !
So much for the police-court , ” said Holmes thoughtfully , tossing aside the paper .
“ The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other .
You see , Watson , our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect .
Here is the stone ; the stone came from the goose , and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker , the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you .
So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has <unk> in this little mystery .
To do this , we must try the <unk> means first , and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers .
If this fail , I shall have <unk> to other methods . ” “ What will you say ? ” “ Give me a pencil and that slip of paper .
Now , then : ‘ <unk> at the corner of Goodge Street , a goose and a black felt hat .
Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6 : 30 this evening at <unk> , Baker Street . ’ That is clear and <unk> . ” “ Very .
But will he see it ? ” “ Well , he is sure to keep an eye on the papers , since , to a poor man , the loss was a heavy one .
He was clearly so scared by his <unk> in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight , but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird .
Then , again , the introduction of his name will cause him to see it , for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it .
Here you are , Peterson , run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers . ” “ In which , sir ? ” “ Oh , in the _ <unk> _ , _ Star _ , _ <unk> <unk> _ , _ St.
James ’ s <unk> _ , _ <unk> <unk> _ , _ <unk> _ , _ <unk> _ , and any others that occur to you . ” “ Very well , sir .
And this stone ? ” “ Ah , yes , I shall keep the stone .
Thank you .
And , I say , Peterson , just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me , for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring . ” When the commissionaire had gone , Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light .
“ It ’ s a <unk> thing , ” said he .
“ Just see how it <unk> and <unk> .
Of course it is a <unk> and <unk> of crime .
Every good stone is .
They are the devil ’ s pet <unk> .
In the larger and older jewels every <unk> may stand for a <unk> deed .
This stone is not yet twenty years old .
It was found in the banks of the <unk> <unk> in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle , save that it is blue in shade instead of <unk> red .
In spite of its youth , it has already a sinister history .
There have been two <unk> , a <unk> , a suicide , and several robberies brought about for the sake of this <unk> weight of <unk> charcoal .
Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a <unk> to the gallows and the prison ?
I ’ ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it . ” “ Do you think that this man Horner is innocent ? ” “ I cannot tell . ” “ Well , then , do you imagine that this other one , Henry Baker , had anything to do with the matter ? ” “ It is , I think , much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man , who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold .
That , however , I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement . ” “ And you can do nothing until then ? ” “ Nothing . ” “ In that case I shall continue my professional round .
But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned , for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business . ” “ Very glad to see you .
I <unk> at seven .
There is a woodcock , I believe .
By the way , in view of recent <unk> , perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop . ” I had been <unk> at a case , and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more .
As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright <unk> which was thrown from the <unk> .
Just as I arrived the door was opened , and we were shown up together to Holmes ’ room .
“ Mr.
Henry Baker , I believe , ” said he , rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of <unk> which he could so readily assume .
“ Pray take this chair by the fire , Mr. Baker .
It is a cold night , and I observe that your <unk> is more <unk> for summer than for <unk> .
Ah , Watson , you have just come at the right time .
Is that your hat , Mr. Baker ? ” “ Yes , sir , that is undoubtedly my hat . ” He was a large man with <unk> shoulders , a massive head , and a broad , <unk> face , <unk> down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown .
A touch of red in nose and cheeks , with a slight <unk> of his extended hand , recalled Holmes ’ surmise as to his habits .
His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front , with the collar turned up , and his <unk> wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt .
He spoke in a slow <unk> fashion , <unk> his words with care , and gave the impression generally of a man of <unk> and letters who had had <unk> at the hands of fortune .
“ We have retained these things for some days , ” said Holmes , “ because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address .
I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise . ” Our visitor gave a rather <unk> laugh .
“ <unk> have not been so <unk> with me as they once were , ” he remarked .
“ I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who <unk> me had carried off both my hat and the bird .
I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them . ” “ Very naturally .
By the way , about the bird , we were compelled to eat it . ” “ To eat it ! ” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement .
“ Yes , it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so .
But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard , which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh , will answer your purpose equally well ? ” “ Oh , certainly , certainly , ” answered Mr. Baker with a <unk> of relief .
“ Of course , we still have the <unk> , legs , crop , and so on of your own bird , so if you wish — ” The man burst into a hearty laugh .
“ They might be useful to me as <unk> of my adventure , ” said he , “ but beyond that I can hardly see what use the _ <unk> <unk> _ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me .
No , sir , I think that , with your permission , I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard . ” Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight <unk> of his shoulders .
“ There is your hat , then , and there your bird , ” said he .
“ By the way , would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from ?
I am somewhat of a <unk> <unk> , and I have seldom seen a better grown goose . ” “ Certainly , sir , ” said Baker , who had risen and <unk> his newly gained property under his arm .
“ There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn , near the Museum — we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day , you understand .
This year our good <unk> , Windigate by name , instituted a goose club , by which , on consideration of some few pence every week , we were each to receive a bird at Christmas .
My pence were <unk> paid , and the rest is familiar to you .
I am much indebted to you , sir , for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity . ” With a comical <unk> of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way .
“ So much for Mr. Henry Baker , ” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him .
“ It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter .
Are you hungry , Watson ? ” “ Not particularly . ” “ Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot . ” “ By all means . ” It was a bitter night , so we drew on our <unk> and wrapped <unk> about our <unk> .
Outside , the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky , and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol <unk> .
Our footfalls rang out <unk> and loudly as we swung through the doctors ’ quarter , <unk> Street , <unk> Street , and so through <unk> Street into Oxford Street .
In a quarter of an hour we were in <unk> at the Alpha Inn , which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn .
Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the <unk> , <unk> landlord .
“ Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese , ” said he .
“ My geese ! ” The man seemed surprised .
“ Yes .
I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker , who was a member of your goose club . ” “ Ah !
yes , I see .
But you see , sir , them ’ s not _ our _ geese . ” “ Indeed !
Whose , then ? ” “ Well , I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden . ” “ Indeed ?
I know some of them .
Which was it ? ” “ Breckinridge is his name . ” “ Ah !
I don ’ t know him .
Well , here ’ s your good health landlord , and <unk> to your house .
Good-night . ” “ Now for Mr. Breckinridge , ” he continued , buttoning up his coat as we came out into the <unk> air .
“ Remember , Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain , we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years ’ <unk> <unk> unless we can establish his innocence .
It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt ; but , in any case , we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police , and which a singular chance has placed in our hands .
Let us follow it out to the bitter end .
<unk> to the south , then , and quick march ! ” We passed across Holborn , down <unk> Street , and so through a <unk> of <unk> to Covent Garden <unk> .
One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it , and the proprietor a <unk> man , with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was <unk> a boy to put up the shutters .
“ Good-evening .
It ’ s a cold night , ” said Holmes .
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion .
“ Sold out of geese , I see , ” continued Holmes , pointing at the bare slabs of <unk> .
“ Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning . ” “ That ’ s no good . ” “ Well , there are some on the stall with the <unk> . ” “ Ah , but I was recommended to you . ” “ Who by ? ” “ The landlord of the Alpha . ” “ Oh , yes ; I sent him a couple of dozen . ” “ <unk> birds they were , too .
Now where did you get them from ? ” To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman .
“ Now , then , <unk> , ” said he , with his head cocked and his arms <unk> , “ what are you driving at ?
Let ’ s have it straight , now . ” “ It is straight enough .
I should like to know who sold you the geese which you <unk> to the Alpha . ” “ Well then , I <unk> ’ t tell you .
So now ! ” “ Oh , it is a matter of no importance ; but I don ’ t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle . ” “ <unk> !
You ’ d be as warm , maybe , if you were as <unk> as I am .
When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business ; but it ’ s ‘ Where are the geese ? ’ and ‘ Who did you sell the geese to ? ’ and ‘ What will you take for the geese ? ’ One would think they were the only geese in the world , to hear the fuss that is made over them . ” “ Well , I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries , ” said Holmes carelessly .
“ If you won ’ t tell us the bet is off , that is all .
But I ’ m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls , and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred . ” “ Well , then , you ’ ve lost your fiver , for it ’ s town bred , ” snapped the salesman .
“ It ’ s nothing of the kind . ” “ I say it is . ” “ I don ’ t believe it . ” “ D ’ you think you know more about fowls than I , who have <unk> them ever since I was a <unk> ?
I tell you , all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred . ” “ You ’ ll never persuade me to believe that . ” “ Will you bet , then ? ” “ It ’ s merely taking your money , for I know that I am right .
But I ’ ll have a sovereign on with you , just to <unk> you not to be obstinate . ” The salesman chuckled <unk> .
“ Bring me the books , <unk> , ” said he .
The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great <unk> one , laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp .
“ Now then , Mr. <unk> , ” said the salesman , “ I thought that I was out of geese , but before I <unk> you ’ ll find that there is still one left in my shop .
You see this little book ? ” “ Well ? ” “ That ’ s the list of the folk from whom I buy .
D ’ you see ?
Well , then , here on this page are the country folk , and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger .
Now , then !
You see this other page in red ink ?
Well , that is a list of my town <unk> .
Now , look at that third name .
Just read it out to me . ” “ Mrs.
Oakshott , 117 , Brixton Road — <unk> , ” read Holmes .
“ Quite so .
Now turn that up in the ledger . ” Holmes turned to the page indicated .
“ Here you are , ‘ Mrs.
Oakshott , 117 , Brixton Road , egg and <unk> <unk> . ’ ” “ Now , then , what ’ s the last <unk> ? ” “ ‘ December 22nd .
<unk> geese at 7 _ s _ .
6 _ d _ . ’ ” “ Quite so .
There you are .
And <unk> ? ” “ ‘ Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha , at <unk> _ s _ . ’ ” “ What have you to say now ? ” Sherlock Holmes looked deeply <unk> .
He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the <unk> , turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words .
A few yards off he stopped under a <unk> and laughed in the hearty , noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him .
“ When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘ <unk> ’ <unk> ’ protruding out of his pocket , you can always draw him by a bet , ” said he .
“ I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him , that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a <unk> .
Well , Watson , we are , I fancy , nearing the end of our quest , and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night , or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow .
It is clear from what that <unk> fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter , and I should — ” His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left .
<unk> round we saw a little <unk> fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp , while Breckinridge , the salesman , framed in the door of his stall , was shaking his fists fiercely at the <unk> figure .
“ I ’ ve had enough of you and your geese , ” he shouted .
“ I wish you were all at the devil together .
If you come <unk> me any more with your <unk> talk I ’ ll set the dog at you .
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I ’ ll answer her , but what have you to do with it ?
Did I buy the geese off you ? ” “ No ; but one of them was mine all the same , ” <unk> the little man .
“ Well , then , ask Mrs. Oakshott for it . ” “ She told me to ask you . ” “ Well , you can ask the King of <unk> , for all I care .
I ’ ve had enough of it .
Get out of this ! ” He rushed fiercely forward , and the <unk> <unk> away into the darkness .
“ Ha !
this may save us a visit to Brixton Road , ” whispered Holmes .
“ Come with me , and we will see what is to be made of this fellow . ” <unk> through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the <unk> stalls , my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder .
He sprang round , and I could see in the <unk> that every <unk> of colour had been driven from his face .
“ Who are you , then ?
What do you want ? ” he asked in a <unk> voice .
“ You will excuse me , ” said Holmes blandly , “ but I could not help <unk> the questions which you put to the salesman just now .
I think that I could be of assistance to you . ” “ You ?
Who are you ?
How could you know anything of the matter ? ” “ My name is Sherlock Holmes .
It is my business to know what other people don ’ t know . ” “ But you can know nothing of this ? ” “ Excuse me , I know everything of it .
You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott , of Brixton Road , to a salesman named Breckinridge , by him in turn to Mr. Windigate , of the Alpha , and by him to his club , of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member . ” “ Oh , sir , you are the very man whom I have <unk> to meet , ” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and <unk> fingers .
“ I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter . ” Sherlock Holmes <unk> a four-wheeler which was passing .
“ In that case we had better discuss it in a <unk> room rather than in this <unk> <unk> , ” said he .
“ But pray tell me , before we go farther , who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting . ” The man hesitated for an instant .
“ My name is John <unk> , ” he answered with a <unk> glance .
“ No , no ; the real name , ” said Holmes <unk> .
“ It is always awkward doing business with an <unk> . ” A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger .
“ Well then , ” said he , “ my real name is James Ryder . ” “ Precisely so .
<unk> attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan .
Pray step into the cab , and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know . ” The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with <unk> , <unk> eyes , as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a <unk> or of a catastrophe .
Then he stepped into the cab , and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street .
Nothing had been said during our drive , but the high , thin breathing of our new companion , and the <unk> and <unk> of his hands , spoke of the nervous tension within him .
“ Here we are ! ” said Holmes cheerily as we <unk> into the room .
“ The fire looks very <unk> in this weather .
You look cold , Mr. Ryder .
Pray take the basket-chair .
I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours .
Now , then !
You want to know what became of those geese ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ Or rather , I fancy , of that goose .
It was one bird , I imagine in which you were interested — white , with a black bar across the tail . ” Ryder <unk> with emotion .
“ Oh , sir , ” he cried , “ can you tell me where it went to ? ” “ It came here . ” “ Here ? ” “ Yes , and a most remarkable bird it proved .
I don ’ t wonder that you should take an interest in it .
It laid an egg after it was dead — the <unk> , brightest little blue egg that ever was seen .
I have it here in my <unk> . ” Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand .
Holmes unlocked his <unk> and held up the blue carbuncle , which shone out like a star , with a cold , brilliant , <unk> radiance .
Ryder stood <unk> with a drawn face , uncertain whether to claim or to <unk> it .
“ The game ’ s up , Ryder , ” said Holmes quietly .
“ Hold up , man , or you ’ ll be into the fire !
Give him an arm back into his chair , Watson .
He ’ s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity .
Give him a dash of brandy .
So !
Now he looks a little more human .
What a <unk> it is , to be sure ! ” For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen , but the brandy brought a <unk> of colour into his cheeks , and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his <unk> .
“ I have almost every link in my hands , and all the proofs which I could possibly need , so there is little which you need tell me .
Still , that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete .
You had heard , Ryder , of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar ’ s ? ” “ It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it , ” said he in a crackling voice .
“ I see — her <unk> ’ s waiting-maid .
Well , the temptation of sudden wealth so easily <unk> was too much for you , as it has been for better men before you ; but you were not very <unk> in the means you used .
It seems to me , Ryder , that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you .
You knew that this man Horner , the plumber , had been concerned in some such matter before , and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him .
What did you do , then ?
You made some small job in my lady ’ s room — you and your confederate Cusack — and you managed that he should be the man sent for .
Then , when he had left , you rifled the jewel-case , raised the alarm , and had this unfortunate man arrested .
You then — ” Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion ’ s knees .
“ For God ’ s sake , have mercy ! ” he shrieked .
“ Think of my father !
Of my mother !
It would break their hearts .
I never went wrong before !
I never will again .
I swear it .
I ’ ll swear it on a <unk> .
Oh , don ’ t bring it into court !
For <unk> ’ s sake , don ’ t ! ” “ Get back into your chair ! ” said Holmes sternly .
“ It is very well to <unk> and crawl now , but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing . ” “ I will fly , Mr. Holmes .
I will leave the country , sir .
Then the charge against him will break down . ” “ Hum !
We will talk about that .
And now let us hear a true account of the next act .
How came the stone into the goose , and how came the goose into the open market ?
Tell us the truth , for there lies your only hope of safety . ” Ryder passed his tongue over his <unk> lips .
“ I will tell you it just as it happened , sir , ” said he .
“ When Horner had been arrested , it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once , for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room .
There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe .
I went out , as if on some commission , and I made for my sister ’ s house .
She had married a man named Oakshott , and lived in Brixton Road , where she fattened fowls for the market .
All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective ; and , for all that it was a cold night , the <unk> was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road .
My sister asked me what was the matter , and why I was so pale ; but I told her that I had been <unk> by the jewel robbery at the hotel .
Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and <unk> what it would be best to do .
“ I had a friend once called <unk> , who went to the bad , and has just been <unk> his time in <unk> .
One day he had met me , and fell into talk about the ways of thieves , and how they could get rid of what they stole .
I knew that he would be true to me , for I knew one or two things about him ; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn , where he lived , and take him into my confidence .
He would show me how to turn the stone into money .
But how to get to him in safety ?
I thought of the <unk> I had gone through in coming from the hotel .
I might at any moment be seized and searched , and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket .
I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were <unk> about round my feet , and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived .
“ My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present , and I knew that she was always as good as her word .
I would take my goose now , and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn .
There was a little <unk> in the yard , and behind this I drove one of the birds — a fine big one , white , with a barred tail .
I caught it , and <unk> its bill open , I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach .
The bird gave a <unk> , and I felt the stone pass along its <unk> and down into its crop .
But the creature flapped and struggled , and out came my sister to know what was the matter .
As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others .
“ ‘ Whatever were you doing with that bird , Jem ? ’ says she .
“ ‘ Well , ’ said I , ‘ you said you ’ d give me one for Christmas , and I was feeling which was the <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Oh , ’ says she , ‘ we ’ ve set yours aside for you — Jem ’ s bird , we call it .
It ’ s the big white one over <unk> .
There ’ s twenty-six of them , which makes one for you , and one for us , and two dozen for the market . ’ “ ‘ Thank you , Maggie , ’ says I ; ‘ but if it is all the same to you , I ’ d rather have that one I was handling just now . ’ “ ‘ The other is a good three pound heavier , ’ said she , ‘ and we fattened it <unk> for you . ’ “ ‘ Never mind .
I ’ ll have the other , and I ’ ll take it now , ’ said I.
“ ‘ Oh , just as you like , ’ said she , a little <unk> .
‘ Which is it you want , then ? ’ “ ‘ That white one with the barred tail , right in the middle of the <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Oh , very well .
<unk> it and take it with you . ’ “ Well , I did what she said , Mr. Holmes , and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn .
I told my pal what I had done , for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to .
He laughed until he choked , and we got a knife and opened the goose .
My heart turned to water , for there was no sign of the stone , and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred .
I left the bird , rushed back to my sister ’ s , and hurried into the back yard .
There was not a bird to be seen there .
“ ‘ Where are they all , Maggie ? ’ I cried .
“ ‘ Gone to the dealer ’ s , Jem . ’ “ ‘ Which dealer ’ s ? ’ “ ‘ Breckinridge , of Covent Garden . ’ “ ‘ But was there another with a barred tail ? ’ I asked , ‘ the same as the one I <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ Yes , Jem ; there were two <unk> ones , and I could never tell them apart . ’ “ Well , then , of course I saw it all , and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge ; but he had sold the lot at once , and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone .
You heard him yourselves to-night .
Well , he has always answered me like that .
My sister thinks that I am going mad .
Sometimes I think that I am myself .
And now — and now I am myself a <unk> thief , without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character .
God help me !
God help me ! ” He burst into <unk> <unk> , with his face buried in his hands .
There was a long silence , broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes ’ finger-tips upon the edge of the table .
Then my friend rose and threw open the door .
“ Get out ! ” said he .
“ What , sir !
Oh , Heaven bless you ! ” “ No more words .
Get out ! ” And no more words were needed .
There was a rush , a clatter upon the stairs , the bang of a door , and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street .
“ After all , Watson , ” said Holmes , reaching up his hand for his clay pipe , “ I am not retained by the police to supply their <unk> .
If Horner were in danger it would be another thing ; but this fellow will not appear against him , and the case must <unk> .
I suppose that I am <unk> a felony , but it is just possible that I am saving a soul .
This fellow will not go wrong again ; he is too terribly frightened .
<unk> him to gaol now , and you make him a <unk> for life .
Besides , it is the season of forgiveness .
<unk> has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem , and its solution is its own reward .
If you will have the goodness to touch the bell , Doctor , we will begin another investigation , in which , also a bird will be the chief feature . ” VIII .
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> <unk> On glancing over my notes of the <unk> odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes , I find many <unk> , some <unk> , a large number merely strange , but none commonplace ; for , working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the <unk> of wealth , he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual , and even the fantastic .
Of all these varied cases , however , I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran .
The events in question occurred in the early days of my <unk> with Holmes , when we were sharing rooms as <unk> in Baker Street .
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before , but a promise of secrecy was made at the time , from which I have only been <unk> during the last month by the <unk> death of the lady to whom the pledge was given .
It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light , for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth .
It was early in April in the year ’ 83 that I <unk> one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing , fully dressed , by the side of my bed .
He was a late <unk> , as a rule , and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven , I <unk> up at him in some surprise , and perhaps just a little <unk> , for I was myself regular in my habits .
“ Very sorry to knock you up , Watson , ” said he , “ but it ’ s the common lot this morning .
Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up , she <unk> upon me , and I on you . ” “ What is it , then — a fire ? ” “ No ; a client .
It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement , who <unk> upon seeing me .
She is waiting now in the sitting-room .
Now , when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning , and knock sleepy people up out of their beds , I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate .
Should it prove to be an interesting case , you would , I am sure , wish to follow it from the <unk> .
I thought , at any rate , that I should call you and give you the chance . ” “ My dear fellow , I would not miss it for anything . ” I had no <unk> pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations , and in admiring the <unk> deductions , as swift as <unk> , and yet always founded on a logical <unk> with which he <unk> the problems which were submitted to him .
I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to <unk> my friend down to the sitting-room .
A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled , who had been sitting in the window , rose as we entered .
“ <unk> , madam , ” said Holmes cheerily .
“ My name is Sherlock Holmes .
This is my intimate friend and associate , Dr. Watson , before whom you can speak as freely as before myself .
Ha !
I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire .
Pray draw up to it , and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee , for I observe that you are <unk> . ” “ It is not cold which makes me <unk> , ” said the woman in a low voice , <unk> her seat as <unk> .
“ What , then ? ” “ It is fear , Mr. Holmes .
It is terror . ” She raised her veil as she spoke , and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation , her face all drawn and grey , with <unk> frightened eyes , like those of some <unk> animal .
Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty , but her hair was shot with <unk> grey , and her expression was weary and haggard .
Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick , <unk> glances .
“ You must not fear , ” said he <unk> , bending forward and <unk> her <unk> .
“ We shall soon set matters right , I have no doubt .
You have come in by train this morning , I see . ” “ You know me , then ? ” “ No , but I observe the second half of a return <unk> in the palm of your left glove .
You must have started early , and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart , along heavy roads , before you reached the station . ” The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion .
“ There is no mystery , my dear madam , ” said he , smiling .
“ The left arm of your jacket is <unk> with mud in no less than seven places .
The marks are perfectly fresh .
There is no <unk> save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way , and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver . ” “ Whatever your reasons may be , you are perfectly correct , ” said she .
“ I started from home before six , reached Leatherhead at twenty past , and came in by the first train to Waterloo .
Sir , I can stand this strain no longer ; I shall go mad if it <unk> .
I have no one to turn to — none , save only one , who <unk> for me , and he , poor fellow , can be of little aid .
I have heard of you , Mr. Holmes ; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh , whom you helped in the hour of her <unk> need .
It was from her that I had your address .
Oh , sir , do you not think that you could help me , too , and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which <unk> me ?
At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services , but in a month or six weeks I shall be married , with the control of my own income , and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful . ” Holmes turned to his desk and , unlocking it , drew out a small <unk> , which he consulted .
“ Farintosh , ” said he .
“ Ah yes , I recall the case ; it was concerned with an <unk> <unk> .
I think it was before your time , Watson .
I can only say , madam , that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend .
As to reward , my profession is its own reward ; but you are at liberty to <unk> whatever expenses I may be put to , at the time which suits you best .
And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter . ” “ Alas ! ” replied our visitor , “ the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague , and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points , which might seem trivial to another , that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman .
He does not say so , but I can read it from his soothing answers and <unk> eyes .
But I have heard , Mr. Holmes , that you can see deeply into the <unk> wickedness of the human heart .
You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which <unk> me . ” “ I am all attention , madam . ” “ My name is Helen Stoner , and I am living with my stepfather , who is the last survivor of one of the <unk> <unk> families in England , the Roylotts of Stoke Moran , on the <unk> border of Surrey . ” Holmes nodded his head .
“ The name is familiar to me , ” said he .
“ The family was at one time among the richest in England , and the <unk> extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north , and Hampshire in the west .
In the last <unk> , however , four successive <unk> were of a <unk> and <unk> disposition , and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the <unk> .
Nothing was left save a few acres of ground , and the <unk> house , which is itself crushed under a heavy <unk> .
The last <unk> dragged out his existence there , living the horrible life of an aristocratic <unk> ; but his only son , my stepfather , seeing that he must <unk> himself to the new conditions , <unk> an advance from a relative , which <unk> him to take a medical degree and went out to <unk> , where , by his professional skill and his force of character , he established a large practice .
In a fit of anger , however , caused by some robberies which had been <unk> in the house , he beat his <unk> butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence .
As it was , he suffered a long <unk> of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man .
“ When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother , Mrs. Stoner , the young <unk> of <unk> Stoner , of the <unk> <unk> .
My sister Julia and I were twins , and we were only two years old at the time of my mother ’ s <unk> .
She had a considerable sum of money — not less than £ 1000 a year — and this she <unk> to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him , with a provision that a certain <unk> sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage .
Shortly after our return to England my mother died — she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near <unk> .
Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old <unk> house at Stoke Moran .
The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants , and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness .
“ But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time .
<unk> of making friends and <unk> visits with our neighbours , who had at first been <unk> to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat , he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in <unk> quarrels with whoever might cross his path .
Violence of temper approaching to <unk> has been hereditary in the men of the family , and in my stepfather ’ s case it had , I believe , been <unk> by his long residence in the <unk> .
A series of disgraceful <unk> took place , two of which ended in the police-court , until at last he became the terror of the village , and the <unk> would fly at his approach , for he is a man of immense strength , and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger .
“ Last week he hurled the local <unk> over a <unk> into a stream , and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure .
He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies , and he would give these <unk> leave to <unk> upon the few acres of <unk> land which represent the family estate , and would accept in return the <unk> of their <unk> , wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end .
He has a passion also for Indian <unk> , which are sent over to him by a correspondent , and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon , which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the <unk> almost as much as their master .
“ You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives .
No servant would stay with us , and for a long time we did all the work of the house .
She was but thirty at the time of her death , and yet her hair had already begun to <unk> , even as mine has . ” “ Your sister is dead , then ? ” “ She died just two years ago , and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you .
You can understand that , living the life which I have described , we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position .
We had , however , an aunt , my mother ’ s maiden sister , Miss <unk> <unk> , who lives near Harrow , and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady ’ s house .
Julia went there at Christmas two years ago , and met there a <unk> major of <unk> , to whom she became engaged .
My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage ; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding , the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion . ” Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a <unk> , but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor .
“ Pray be precise as to details , ” said he .
“ It is easy for me to be so , for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory .
The <unk> is , as I have already said , very old , and only one wing is now inhabited .
The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor , the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the <unk> .
Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott ’ s , the second my sister ’ s , and the third my own .
There is no communication between them , but they all open out into the same corridor .
Do I make myself plain ? ” “ <unk> so . ” “ The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn .
That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early , though we knew that he had not retired to rest , for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke .
She left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for some time , <unk> about her approaching wedding .
At eleven o ’ clock she rose to leave me , but she paused at the door and looked back .
“ ‘ Tell me , Helen , ’ said she , ‘ have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night ? ’ “ ‘ Never , ’ said I.
“ ‘ I suppose that you could not possibly whistle , yourself , in your sleep ? ’ “ ‘ Certainly not .
But why ? ’ “ ‘ Because during the last few nights I have always , about three in the morning , heard a low , clear whistle .
I am a light sleeper , and it has awakened me .
I cannot tell where it came from — perhaps from the next room , perhaps from the lawn .
I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it . ’ “ ‘ No , I have not .
It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation . ’ “ ‘ Very likely .
And yet if it were on the lawn , I wonder that you did not hear it also . ’ “ ‘ Ah , but I sleep more heavily than you . ’ “ ‘ Well , it is of no great <unk> , at any rate . ’ She smiled back at me , closed my door , and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock . ” “ Indeed , ” said Holmes .
“ Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ And why ? ” “ I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon .
We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked . ” “ Quite so .
Pray proceed with your statement . ” “ I could not sleep that night .
A vague feeling of <unk> misfortune impressed me .
My sister and I , you will recollect , were twins , and you know how subtle are the links which <unk> two <unk> which are so closely <unk> .
It was a wild night .
The wind was <unk> outside , and the rain was beating and <unk> against the windows .
Suddenly , amid all the hubbub of the gale , there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman .
I knew that it was my sister ’ s voice .
I sprang from my bed , wrapped a <unk> round me , and rushed into the corridor .
As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle , such as my sister described , and a few moments later a clanging sound , as if a mass of metal had fallen .
As I ran down the passage , my sister ’ s door was unlocked , and <unk> slowly upon its hinges .
I stared at it <unk> , not knowing what was about to issue from it .
By the light of the <unk> I saw my sister appear at the opening , her face <unk> with terror , her hands groping for help , her whole figure <unk> to and fro like that of a drunkard .
I ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground .
She writhed as one who is in terrible pain , and her limbs were dreadfully <unk> .
At first I thought that she had not recognised me , but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget , ‘ Oh , my God !
Helen !
It was the band !
The speckled band ! ’ There was something else which she would <unk> have said , and she <unk> with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor ’ s room , but a fresh <unk> seized her and choked her words .
I rushed out , calling loudly for my stepfather , and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown .
When he reached my sister ’ s side she was unconscious , and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village , all efforts were in vain , for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness .
Such was the dreadful end of my <unk> sister . ” “ One moment , ” said Holmes , “ are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound ?
Could you swear to it ? ” “ That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry .
It is my strong impression that I heard it , and yet , among the crash of the gale and the <unk> of an old house , I may possibly have been deceived . ” “ Was your sister dressed ? ” “ No , she was in her <unk> .
In her right hand was found the <unk> stump of a match , and in her left a <unk> . ” “ <unk> that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place .
That is important .
And what conclusions did the coroner come to ? ” “ He <unk> the case with great care , for Dr. Roylott ’ s conduct had long been <unk> in the county , but he was unable to find any <unk> cause of death .
My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side , and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars , which were secured every night .
The walls were carefully sounded , and were shown to be quite solid all round , and the flooring was also thoroughly examined , with the same result .
The chimney is wide , but is barred up by four large <unk> .
It is certain , therefore , that my sister was quite alone when she met her end .
Besides , there were no marks of any violence upon her . ” “ How about poison ? ” “ The doctors examined her for it , but without success . ” “ What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of , then ? ” “ It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock , though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine . ” “ Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time ? ” “ Yes , there are nearly always some there . ” “ Ah , and what did you gather from this allusion to a band — a speckled band ? ” “ Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium , sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people , perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation .
I do not know whether the spotted <unk> which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange <unk> which she used . ” Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied .
“ These are very deep <unk> , ” said he ; “ pray go on with your narrative . ” “ Two years have passed since then , and my life has been until lately <unk> than ever .
A month ago , however , a dear friend , whom I have known for many years , has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage .
His name is Armitage — <unk> Armitage — the second son of Mr. Armitage , of <unk> <unk> , near Reading .
My stepfather has offered no <unk> to the match , and we are to be married in the course of the spring .
Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building , and my bedroom wall has been pierced , so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died , and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept .
<unk> , then , my <unk> of terror when last night , as I lay awake , thinking over her terrible fate , I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the <unk> of her own death .
I sprang up and lit the lamp , but nothing was to be seen in the room .
I was too shaken to go to bed again , however , so I dressed , and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down , got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn , which is opposite , and drove to Leatherhead , from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice . ” “ You have done wisely , ” said my friend .
“ But have you told me all ? ” “ Yes , all . ” “ Miss Roylott , you have not .
You are screening your stepfather . ” “ Why , what do you mean ? ” For answer Holmes pushed back the <unk> of black <unk> which <unk> the hand that lay upon our visitor ’ s knee .
Five little <unk> <unk> , the marks of four fingers and a thumb , were printed upon the white wrist .
“ You have been cruelly used , ” said Holmes .
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist .
“ He is a hard man , ” she said , “ and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength . ” There was a long silence , during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire .
“ This is a very deep business , ” he said at last .
“ There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action .
Yet we have not a moment to lose .
If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day , would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather ? ” “ As it happens , he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business .
It is probable that he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to disturb you .
We have a housekeeper now , but she is old and foolish , and I could easily get her out of the way . ” “ Excellent .
You are not averse to this <unk> , Watson ? ” “ By no means . ” “ Then we shall both come .
What are you going to do yourself ? ” “ I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town .
But I shall return by the twelve o ’ clock train , so as to be there in time for your coming . ” “ And you may expect us early in the afternoon .
I have myself some small business matters to attend to .
Will you not wait and breakfast ? ” “ No , I must go .
My heart is <unk> already since I have confided my trouble to you .
I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon . ” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room .
“ And what do you think of it all , Watson ? ” asked Sherlock Holmes , leaning back in his chair .
“ It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business . ” “ <unk> enough and sinister enough . ” “ Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound , and that the door , window , and chimney are <unk> , then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end . ” “ What becomes , then , of these nocturnal whistles , and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman ? ” “ I cannot think . ” “ When you <unk> the ideas of whistles at night , the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor , the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter ’ s marriage , the dying allusion to a band , and , finally , the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang , which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place , I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines . ” “ But what , then , did the gipsies do ? ” “ I cannot imagine . ” “ I see many objections to any such theory . ” “ And so do I.
It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day .
I want to see whether the objections are fatal , or if they may be explained away .
But what in the name of the devil ! ” The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open , and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture .
His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural , having a black top-hat , a long frock-coat , and a pair of high gaiters , with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand .
So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the <unk> , and his <unk> seemed to <unk> it across from side to side .
A large face , seared with a thousand wrinkles , burned yellow with the sun , and marked with every evil passion , was turned from one to the other of us , while his <unk> , <unk> eyes , and his high , thin , fleshless nose , gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey .
“ Which of you is Holmes ? ” asked this <unk> .
“ My name , sir ; but you have the advantage of me , ” said my companion quietly .
“ I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott , of Stoke Moran . ” “ Indeed , Doctor , ” said Holmes blandly .
“ Pray take a seat . ” “ I will do nothing of the kind .
My stepdaughter has been here .
I have traced her .
What has she been saying to you ? ” “ It is a little cold for the time of the year , ” said Holmes .
“ What has she been saying to you ? ” screamed the old man furiously .
“ But I have heard that the <unk> promise well , ” continued my companion <unk> .
“ Ha !
You put me off , do you ? ” said our new visitor , taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop .
“ I know you , you scoundrel !
I have heard of you before .
You are Holmes , the <unk> . ” My friend smiled .
“ Holmes , the <unk> ! ” His smile broadened .
“ Holmes , the Scotland Yard <unk> ! ” Holmes chuckled heartily .
“ Your conversation is most entertaining , ” said he .
“ When you go out close the door , for there is a <unk> draught . ” “ I will go when I have had my say .
Don ’ t you dare to <unk> with my affairs .
I know that Miss Stoner has been here .
I traced her !
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of !
See here . ” He stepped swiftly forward , seized the poker , and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands .
“ See that you keep yourself out of my grip , ” he snarled , and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room .
“ He seems a very amiable person , ” said Holmes , laughing .
“ I am not quite so bulky , but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more <unk> than his own . ” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and , with a sudden effort , straightened it out again .
“ <unk> his having the <unk> to <unk> me with the official detective force !
This incident gives <unk> to our investigation , however , and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in <unk> this brute to trace her .
And now , Watson , we shall order breakfast , and afterwards I shall walk down to <unk> ’ <unk> , where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter . ” It was nearly one o ’ clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his <unk> .
He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper , scrawled over with notes and figures .
“ I have seen the will of the deceased wife , ” said he .
“ To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned .
The <unk> income , which at the time of the wife ’ s death was little short of £ <unk> , is now , through the fall in agricultural prices , not more than £ <unk> .
<unk> daughter can claim an income of £ <unk> , in case of marriage .
It is evident , therefore , that if both <unk> had married , this beauty would have had a mere <unk> , while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent .
My morning ’ s work has not been wasted , since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort .
And now , Watson , this is too serious for <unk> , especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs ; so if you are ready , we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo .
I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket .
An <unk> ’ s No .
2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel <unk> into knots .
That and a <unk> are , I think , all that we need . ” At Waterloo we were fortunate in <unk> a train for Leatherhead , where we <unk> a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey <unk> .
It was a perfect day , with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens .
The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green <unk> , and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth .
To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged .
My companion sat in the front of the trap , his arms folded , his hat pulled down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his breast , buried in the deepest thought .
Suddenly , however , he started , tapped me on the shoulder , and pointed over the meadows .
“ Look there ! ” said he .
A heavily <unk> park stretched up in a gentle slope , <unk> into a <unk> at the highest point .
From amid the branches there <unk> out the grey <unk> and high <unk> of a very old <unk> .
“ Stoke Moran ? ” said he .
“ Yes , sir , that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott , ” remarked the driver .
“ There is some building going on there , ” said Holmes ; “ that is where we are going . ” “ There ’ s the village , ” said the driver , pointing to a <unk> of roofs some distance to the left ; “ but if you want to get to the house , you ’ ll find it shorter to get over this stile , and so by the <unk> over the fields .
There it is , where the lady is walking . ” “ And the lady , I fancy , is Miss Stoner , ” observed Holmes , <unk> his eyes .
“ Yes , I think we had better do as you suggest . ” We got off , paid our fare , and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead .
“ I thought it as well , ” said Holmes as we <unk> the stile , “ that this fellow should think we had come here as <unk> , or on some definite business .
It may stop his gossip .
Good-afternoon , Miss Stoner .
You see that we have been as good as our word . ” Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy .
“ I have been waiting so eagerly for you , ” she cried , shaking hands with us warmly .
“ All has turned out <unk> .
Dr. Roylott has gone to town , and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening . ” “ We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor ’ s acquaintance , ” said Holmes , and in a few words he <unk> out what had occurred .
Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened .
“ Good heavens ! ” she cried , “ he has followed me , then . ” “ So it appears . ” “ He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him .
What will he say when he returns ? ” “ He must guard himself , for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track .
You must lock yourself up from him to-night .
If he is violent , we shall take you away to your aunt ’ s at Harrow .
Now , we must make the best use of our time , so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine . ” The building was of grey , <unk> stone , with a high central portion and two <unk> wings , like the claws of a <unk> , thrown out on each side .
In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards , while the roof was <unk> <unk> in , a picture of ruin .
The central portion was in little better <unk> , but the right-hand block was comparatively modern , and the blinds in the windows , with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys , showed that this was where the family resided .
Some <unk> had been erected against the end wall , and the <unk> had been broken into , but there were no signs of any <unk> at the moment of our visit .
Holmes walked slowly up and down the <unk> lawn and examined with deep attention the <unk> of the windows .
“ This , I take it , belongs to the room in which you used to sleep , the centre one to your sister ’ s , and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott ’ s chamber ? ” “ <unk> so .
But I am now sleeping in the middle one . ” “ <unk> the <unk> , as I understand .
By the way , there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall . ” “ There were none .
I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room . ” “ Ah !
that is suggestive .
Now , on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open .
There are windows in it , of course ? ” “ Yes , but very small ones .
Too narrow for anyone to pass through . ” “ As you both locked your doors at night , your rooms were <unk> from that side .
Now , would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters ? ” Miss Stoner did so , and Holmes , after a careful examination through the open window , endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open , but without success .
There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar .
Then with his lens he <unk> the hinges , but they were of solid iron , built firmly into the massive <unk> .
“ Hum ! ” said he , <unk> his chin in some perplexity , “ my theory certainly presents some difficulties .
No one could pass these shutters if they were <unk> .
Well , we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter . ” A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened .
Holmes refused to examine the third chamber , so we passed at once to the second , that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping , and in which her sister had met with her fate .
It was a homely little room , with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace , after the fashion of old <unk> .
A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner , a narrow <unk> bed in another , and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window .
These articles , with two small <unk> chairs , made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of <unk> carpet in the centre .
The boards round and the <unk> of the walls were of brown , <unk> oak , so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house .
Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every detail of the apartment .
“ Where does that bell communicate with ? ” he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed , the <unk> actually lying upon the pillow .
“ It goes to the housekeeper ’ s room . ” “ It looks <unk> than the other things ? ” “ Yes , it was only put there a couple of years ago . ” “ Your sister asked for it , I suppose ? ” “ No , I never heard of her using it .
We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves . ” “ Indeed , it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there .
You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor . ” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and <unk> swiftly backward and forward , examining minutely the cracks between the boards .
Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was <unk> .
Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall .
Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk <unk> .
“ Why , it ’ s a dummy , ” said he .
“ <unk> ’ t it ring ? ” “ No , it is not even attached to a wire .
This is very interesting .
You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is . ” “ How very absurd !
I never noticed that before . ” “ Very strange ! ” muttered Holmes , pulling at the rope .
“ There are one or two very singular points about this room .
For example , what a fool a <unk> must be to open a ventilator into another room , when , with the same trouble , he might have communicated with the outside air ! ” “ That is also quite modern , ” said the lady .
“ <unk> about the same time as the bell-rope ? ” remarked Holmes .
“ Yes , there were several little <unk> carried out about that time . ” “ They seem to have been of a most interesting character — dummy <unk> , and <unk> which do not <unk> .
With your permission , Miss Stoner , we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment . ” Dr. Grimesby Roylott ’ s chamber was larger than that of his <unk> , but was as plainly furnished .
A <unk> , a small wooden shelf full of books , mostly of a <unk> character , an armchair beside the bed , a plain wooden chair against the wall , a round table , and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye .
Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest .
“ What ’ s in here ? ” he asked , tapping the safe .
“ My stepfather ’ s business papers . ” “ Oh !
you have seen inside , then ? ” “ Only once , some years ago .
I remember that it was full of papers . ” “ There isn ’ t a cat in it , for example ? ” “ No .
What a strange idea ! ” “ Well , look at this ! ” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it .
“ No ; we don ’ t keep a cat .
But there is a cheetah and a baboon . ” “ Ah , yes , of course !
Well , a cheetah is just a big cat , and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in <unk> its wants , I daresay .
There is one point which I should wish to determine . ” He <unk> down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention .
“ Thank you .
That is quite settled , ” said he , rising and putting his lens in his pocket .
“ Hullo !
Here is something interesting ! ” The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed .
The lash , however , was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord .
“ What do you make of that , Watson ? ” “ It ’ s a common enough lash .
But I don ’ t know why it should be tied . ” “ That is not quite so common , is it ?
Ah , me !
it ’ s a wicked world , and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all .
I think that I have seen enough now , Miss Stoner , and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn . ” I had never seen my friend ’ s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation .
We had walked several times up and down the lawn , neither Miss Stoner nor myself <unk> to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his <unk> .
“ It is very essential , Miss Stoner , ” said he , “ that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect . ” “ I shall most certainly do so . ” “ The matter is too serious for any hesitation .
Your life may depend upon your compliance . ” “ I assure you that I am in your hands . ” “ In the first place , both my friend and I must spend the night in your room . ” Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment .
“ Yes , it must be so .
Let me explain .
I believe that that is the village inn over there ? ” “ Yes , that is the Crown . ” “ Very good .
Your windows would be visible from there ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ You must confine yourself to your room , on <unk> of a <unk> , when your stepfather comes back .
Then when you hear him retire for the night , you must open the shutters of your window , <unk> the <unk> , put your lamp there as a signal to us , and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to <unk> .
I have no doubt that , in spite of the repairs , you could manage there for one night . ” “ Oh , yes , easily . ” “ The rest you will leave in our hands . ” “ But what will you do ? ” “ We shall spend the night in your room , and we shall <unk> the cause of this noise which has disturbed you . ” “ I believe , Mr. Holmes , that you have already made up your mind , ” said Miss Stoner , laying her hand upon my companion ’ s sleeve .
“ Perhaps I have . ” “ Then , for pity ’ s sake , tell me what was the cause of my sister ’ s death . ” “ I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak . ” “ You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct , and if she died from some sudden <unk> . ” “ No , I do not think so .
I think that there was probably some more <unk> cause .
And now , Miss Stoner , we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain .
Good-bye , and be brave , for if you will do what I have told you , you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that <unk> you . ” Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn .
They were on the upper floor , and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate , and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House .
At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past , his huge form <unk> up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him .
The boy had some slight difficulty in <unk> the heavy iron gates , and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor ’ s voice and saw the <unk> with which he shook his <unk> fists at him .
The trap drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms .
“ Do you know , Watson , ” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness , “ I have really some <unk> as to taking you to-night .
There is a distinct <unk> of danger . ” “ Can I be of assistance ? ” “ Your presence might be invaluable . ” “ Then I shall certainly come . ” “ It is very kind of you . ” “ You speak of danger .
You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me . ” “ No , but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more .
I imagine that you saw all that I did . ” “ I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope , and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine . ” “ You saw the ventilator , too ? ” “ Yes , but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms .
It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through . ” “ I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran . ” “ My dear Holmes ! ” “ Oh , yes , I did .
You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott ’ s cigar .
Now , of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms .
It could only be a small one , or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner ’ s inquiry .
I deduced a ventilator . ” “ But what harm can there be in that ? ” “ Well , there is at least a curious <unk> of dates .
A ventilator is made , a cord is hung , and a lady who sleeps in the bed <unk> .
Does not that strike you ? ” “ I cannot as yet see any connection . ” “ Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed ? ” “ No . ” “ It was clamped to the floor .
Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before ? ” “ I cannot say that I have . ” “ The lady could not move her bed .
It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope — or so we may call it , since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull . ” “ Holmes , ” I cried , “ I seem to see dimly what you are <unk> at .
We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime . ” “ <unk> enough and horrible enough .
When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals .
He has nerve and he has knowledge .
<unk> and <unk> were among the heads of their profession .
This man strikes even deeper , but I think , Watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still .
But we shall have <unk> enough before the night is over ; for goodness ’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful . ” About nine o ’ clock the light among the trees was <unk> , and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House .
Two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just at the stroke of eleven , a single bright light shone out right in front of us .
“ That is our signal , ” said Holmes , springing to his feet ; “ it comes from the middle window . ” As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord , explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance , and that it was possible that we might spend the night there .
A moment later we were out on the dark road , a chill wind blowing in our <unk> , and one yellow light <unk> in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand .
There was little difficulty in entering the grounds , for <unk> <unk> gaped in the old park wall .
<unk> our way among the trees , we reached the lawn , crossed it , and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there <unk> what seemed to be a hideous and <unk> child , who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness .
“ My God ! ” I whispered ; “ did you see it ? ” Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.
His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation .
Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear .
“ It is a nice household , ” he murmured .
“ That is the baboon . ” I had forgotten the strange <unk> which the Doctor affected .
There was a cheetah , too ; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment .
I confess that I felt easier in my mind when , after following Holmes ’ example and slipping off my shoes , I found myself inside the bedroom .
My companion noiselessly closed the shutters , moved the lamp onto the table , and cast his eyes round the room .
All was as we had seen it in the <unk> .
Then <unk> up to me and making a <unk> of his hand , he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words : “ The least sound would be fatal to our plans . ” I nodded to show that I had heard .
“ We must sit without light .
He would see it through the ventilator . ” I nodded again .
“ Do not go asleep ; your very life may depend upon it .
Have your pistol ready in case we should need it .
I will sit on the side of the bed , and you in that chair . ” I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table .
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane , and this he placed upon the bed beside him .
By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle .
Then he turned down the lamp , and we were left in darkness .
How shall I ever forget that dreadful <unk> ?
I could not hear a sound , not even the drawing of a breath , and yet I knew that my companion sat <unk> , within a few feet of me , in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself .
The shutters cut off the least <unk> of light , and we waited in absolute darkness .
From outside came the occasional cry of a <unk> , and once at our very window a long drawn <unk> <unk> , which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty .
Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock , which <unk> out every quarter of an hour .
How long they seemed , those quarters !
<unk> struck , and one and two and three , and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall .
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator , which vanished immediately , but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning <unk> and <unk> metal .
Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern .
I heard a gentle sound of movement , and then all was silent once more , though the smell grew stronger .
For half an hour I sat with <unk> ears .
Then suddenly another sound became <unk> — a very gentle , soothing sound , like that of a small jet of <unk> <unk> continually from a <unk> .
The instant that we heard it , Holmes sprang from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull .
“ You see it , Watson ? ” he yelled .
“ You see it ? ” But I saw nothing .
At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low , clear whistle , but the sudden glare <unk> into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely .
I could , however , see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and <unk> .
He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened .
It <unk> up louder and louder , a hoarse <unk> of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek .
They say that away down in the village , and even in the <unk> <unk> , that cry raised the sleepers from their beds .
It struck cold to our hearts , and I stood gazing at Holmes , and he at me , until the last <unk> of it had died away into the silence from which it rose .
“ What can it mean ? ” I gasped .
“ It means that it is all over , ” Holmes answered .
“ And perhaps , after all , it is for the best .
Take your pistol , and we will enter Dr. Roylott ’ s room . ” With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor .
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within .
Then he turned the handle and entered , I at his heels , with the cocked pistol in my hand .
It was a singular sight which met our eyes .
On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open , throwing a brilliant <unk> of light upon the iron safe , the door of which was <unk> .
Beside this table , on the wooden chair , sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown , his bare <unk> protruding beneath , and his feet thrust into red <unk> <unk> slippers .
<unk> his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day .
His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful , rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling .
Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band , with <unk> <unk> , which seemed to be bound tightly round his head .
As we entered he made neither sound nor motion .
“ The band !
the speckled band ! ” whispered Holmes .
I took a step forward .
In an instant his strange <unk> began to move , and there <unk> itself from among his hair the <unk> <unk> head and puffed neck of a <unk> <unk> .
“ It is a swamp <unk> ! ” cried Holmes ; “ the deadliest snake in India .
He has died within ten seconds of being bitten .
Violence does , in truth , <unk> upon the violent , and the <unk> <unk> into the pit which he <unk> for another .
Let us thrust this creature back into its den , and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of <unk> and let the county police know what has happened . ” As he spoke he drew the <unk> swiftly from the dead man ’ s lap , and throwing the <unk> round the <unk> ’ s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and , carrying it at arm ’ s length , threw it into the iron safe , which he closed upon it .
Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott , of Stoke Moran .
It is not necessary that I should <unk> a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl , how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow , of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while <unk> playing with a dangerous pet .
The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day .
“ I had , ” said he , “ come to an entirely <unk> conclusion which shows , my dear Watson , how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data .
The presence of the gipsies , and the use of the word ‘ band , ’ which was used by the poor girl , no doubt , to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match , were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent .
I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when , however , it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door .
My attention was speedily drawn , as I have already remarked to you , to this ventilator , and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed .
The discovery that this was a dummy , and that the bed was clamped to the floor , instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed .
The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me , and when I <unk> it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of <unk> from India , I felt that I was probably on the right track .
The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and <unk> man who had had an Eastern training .
The <unk> with which such a poison would take effect would also , from his point of view , be an advantage .
It would be a <unk> coroner , indeed , who could distinguish the two little dark <unk> which would show where the poison fangs had done their work .
Then I thought of the whistle .
Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim .
He had trained it , probably by the use of the milk which we saw , to return to him when summoned .
He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best , with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed .
It might or might not bite the occupant , perhaps she might escape every night for a week , but sooner or later she must fall a victim .
“ I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room .
An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it , which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator .
The sight of the safe , the saucer of milk , and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally <unk> any doubts which may have remained .
The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather <unk> closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant .
Having once made up my mind , you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof .
I heard the creature <unk> as I have no doubt that you did also , and I instantly lit the light and attacked it . ” “ With the result of driving it through the ventilator . ” “ And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side .
Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its <unk> temper , so that it flew upon the first person it saw .
In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott ’ s death , and I cannot say that it is likely to <unk> very heavily upon my conscience . ” IX .
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for solution during the years of our <unk> , there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice — that of Mr. Hatherley ’ s thumb , and that of Colonel <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Of these the latter may have <unk> a finer field for an acute and original observer , but the other was so strange in its <unk> and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record , even if it gave my friend fewer <unk> for those <unk> methods of reasoning by which he <unk> such remarkable results .
The story has , I believe , been told more than once in the newspapers , but , like all such narratives , its effect is much less striking when set forth _ <unk> <unk> _ in a single <unk> of print than when the facts slowly <unk> before your own eyes , and the mystery <unk> gradually away as each new discovery <unk> a step which leads on to the complete truth .
At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me , and the <unk> of two years has hardly served to <unk> the effect .
It was in the summer of ’ 89 , not long after my marriage , that the events occurred which I am now about to <unk> .
I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms , although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to <unk> his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us .
My practice had <unk> increased , and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station , I got a few patients from among the <unk> .
One of these , whom I had <unk> of a painful and <unk> disease , was never weary of advertising my <unk> and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence .
One morning , at a little before seven o ’ clock , I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room .
I dressed hurriedly , for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial , and hastened downstairs .
As I descended , my old <unk> , the guard , came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him .
“ I ’ ve got him here , ” he whispered , <unk> his thumb over his shoulder ; “ he ’ s all right . ” “ What is it , then ? ” I asked , for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had <unk> up in my room .
“ It ’ s a new patient , ” he whispered .
“ I thought I ’ d bring him round myself ; then he <unk> ’ t slip away .
There he is , all safe and sound .
I must go now , Doctor ; I have my <unk> , just the same as you . ” And off he went , this trusty tout , without even giving me time to thank him .
I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table .
He was quietly dressed in a suit of <unk> tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books .
Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped , which was <unk> all over with bloodstains .
He was young , not more than <unk> , I should say , with a strong , <unk> face ; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was <unk> from some strong agitation , which it took all his strength of mind to control .
“ I am sorry to knock you up so early , Doctor , ” said he , “ but I have had a very serious accident during the night .
I came in by train this morning , and on <unk> at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor , a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here .
I gave the maid a card , but I see that she has left it upon the <unk> . ” I took it up and glanced at it .
“ Mr.
<unk> Hatherley , hydraulic engineer , <unk> , Victoria Street ( 3rd floor ) . ” That was the name , style , and <unk> of my morning visitor .
“ I <unk> that I have kept you waiting , ” said I , sitting down in my <unk> .
“ You are fresh from a night journey , I understand , which is in itself a monotonous occupation . ” “ Oh , my night could not be called monotonous , ” said he , and laughed .
He laughed very heartily , with a high , ringing note , leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides .
All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh .
“ <unk> it ! ” I cried ; “ pull yourself together ! ” and I poured out some water from a <unk> .
It was useless , however .
He was off in one of those hysterical <unk> which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone .
Presently he came to himself once more , very weary and <unk> .
“ I have been making a fool of myself , ” he gasped .
“ Not at all .
<unk> this . ” I dashed some brandy into the water , and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks .
“ That ’ s better ! ” said he .
“ And now , Doctor , perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb , or rather to the place where my thumb used to be . ” He <unk> the handkerchief and held out his hand .
It gave even my hardened nerves a <unk> to look at it .
There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red , <unk> surface where the thumb should have been .
It had been <unk> or torn right out from the roots .
“ Good heavens ! ” I cried , “ this is a terrible injury .
It must have <unk> considerably . ” “ Yes , it did .
I fainted when it was done , and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time .
When I came to I found that it was still bleeding , so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a <unk> . ” “ Excellent !
You should have been a surgeon . ” “ It is a question of <unk> , you see , and came within my own province . ” “ This has been done , ” said I , examining the wound , “ by a very heavy and sharp instrument . ” “ A thing like a cleaver , ” said he .
“ An accident , I presume ? ” “ By no means . ” “ What !
a murderous <unk> ? ” “ Very murderous indeed . ” “ You horrify me . ” I <unk> the wound , cleaned it , dressed it , and finally covered it over with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
He lay back without <unk> , though he bit his lip from time to time .
“ How is that ? ” I asked when I had finished .
“ Capital !
Between your brandy and your <unk> , I feel a new man .
I was very weak , but I have had a good deal to go through . ” “ Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter .
It is evidently trying to your nerves . ” “ Oh , no , not now .
I shall have to tell my tale to the police ; but , between ourselves , if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine , I should be surprised if they believed my statement , for it is a very extraordinary one , and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up ; and , even if they believe me , the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done . ” “ Ha ! ” cried I , “ if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved , I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , before you go to the official police . ” “ Oh , I have heard of that fellow , ” answered my visitor , “ and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up , though of course I must use the official police as well .
Would you give me an introduction to him ? ” “ I ’ ll do better .
I ’ ll take you round to him myself . ” “ I should be immensely obliged to you . ” “ We ’ ll call a cab and go together .
We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him .
Do you feel equal to it ? ” “ Yes ; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story . ” “ Then my servant will call a cab , and I shall be with you in an instant . ” I rushed upstairs , explained the matter shortly to my wife , and in five minutes was inside a hansom , driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street .
Sherlock Holmes was , as I expected , lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown , reading the agony column of _ The Times _ and smoking his <unk> pipe , which was composed of all the <unk> and <unk> left from his smokes of the day before , all carefully dried and <unk> on the corner of the mantelpiece .
He received us in his quietly genial fashion , ordered fresh <unk> and <unk> , and joined us in a hearty meal .
When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa , placed a pillow beneath his head , and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach .
“ It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one , Mr. Hatherley , ” said he .
“ Pray , lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home .
Tell us what you can , but stop when you are <unk> and keep up your strength with a little <unk> . ” “ Thank you , ” said my patient , “ but I have felt another man since the doctor <unk> me , and I think that your breakfast has completed the <unk> .
I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible , so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences . ” Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary , <unk> expression which veiled his keen and eager nature , while I sat opposite to him , and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor <unk> to us .
“ You must know , ” said he , “ that I am an orphan and a bachelor , residing alone in lodgings in London .
By profession I am a hydraulic engineer , and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was <unk> to <unk> &amp; <unk> , the well-known firm , of <unk> .
Two years ago , having served my time , and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father ’ s death , I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street .
“ I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a <unk> experience .
To me it has been exceptionally so .
During two years I have had three <unk> and one small job , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me .
My gross takings amount to £ 27 10 _ s _ .
Every day , from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon , I waited in my little den , until at last my heart began to sink , and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all .
“ Yesterday , however , just as I was thinking of leaving the office , my <unk> entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business .
He brought up a card , too , with the name of ‘ Colonel Lysander Stark ’ <unk> upon it .
<unk> at his heels came the colonel himself , a man rather over the middle size , but of an <unk> <unk> .
I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man .
His whole face <unk> away into nose and chin , and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite <unk> over his outstanding bones .
Yet this <unk> seemed to be his natural habit , and due to no disease , for his eye was bright , his step brisk , and his bearing assured .
He was plainly but neatly dressed , and his age , I should judge , would be nearer forty than thirty .
“ ‘ Mr.
Hatherley ? ’ said he , with something of a German accent .
‘ You have been recommended to me , Mr. Hatherley , as being a man who is not only <unk> in his profession but is also discreet and capable of <unk> a secret . ’ “ I bowed , feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address .
‘ May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character ? ’ “ ‘ Well , perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment .
I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London . ’ “ ‘ That is quite correct , ’ I answered ; ‘ but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional <unk> .
I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me ? ’ “ ‘ Undoubtedly so .
But you will find that all I say is really to the point .
I have a professional commission for you , but absolute secrecy is quite essential — absolute secrecy , you understand , and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family . ’ “ ‘ If I promise to keep a secret , ’ said I , ‘ you may absolutely depend upon my doing so . ’ “ He looked very hard at me as I spoke , and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye .
“ ‘ Do you promise , then ? ’ said he at last .
“ ‘ Yes , I promise . ’ “ ‘ <unk> and complete silence before , during , and after ?
No reference to the matter at all , either in word or writing ? ’ “ ‘ I have already given you my word . ’ “ ‘ Very good . ’ He suddenly sprang up , and <unk> like <unk> across the room he flung open the door .
The passage outside was empty .
“ ‘ That ’ s all right , ’ said he , coming back .
‘ I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master ’ s affairs .
Now we can talk in safety . ’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look .
“ A feeling of <unk> , and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange <unk> of this fleshless man .
Even my dread of losing a client could not <unk> me from showing my impatience .
“ ‘ I beg that you will state your business , sir , ’ said I ; ‘ my time is of value . ’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence , but the words came to my lips .
“ ‘ How would fifty guineas for a night ’ s work suit you ? ’ he asked .
“ ‘ Most admirably . ’ “ ‘ I say a night ’ s work , but an hour ’ s would be nearer the mark .
I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic <unk> machine which has got out of <unk> .
If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves .
What do you think of such a commission as that ? ’ “ ‘ The work appears to be light and the pay <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Precisely so .
We shall want you to come to-night by the last train . ’ “ ‘ Where to ? ’ “ ‘ To Eyford , in Berkshire .
It is a little place near the borders of <unk> , and within seven miles of Reading .
There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11 : 15 . ’ “ ‘ Very good . ’ “ ‘ I shall come down in a carriage to meet you . ’ “ ‘ There is a drive , then ? ’ “ ‘ Yes , our little place is quite out in the country .
It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station . ’ “ ‘ Then we can hardly get there before midnight .
I suppose there would be no chance of a train back .
I should be compelled to stop the night . ’ “ ‘ Yes , we could easily give you a <unk> . ’ “ ‘ That is very awkward .
Could I not come at some more <unk> hour ? ’ “ ‘ We have <unk> it best that you should come late .
It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you , a young and unknown man , a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession .
Still , of course , if you would like to draw out of the business , there is plenty of time to do so . ’ “ I thought of the fifty guineas , and of how very useful they would be to me .
‘ Not at all , ’ said I , ‘ I shall be very happy to <unk> myself to your wishes .
I should like , however , to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do . ’ “ ‘ Quite so .
It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity .
I have no wish to <unk> you to anything without your having it all laid before you .
I suppose that we are absolutely safe from <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ Entirely . ’ “ ‘ Then the matter stands thus .
You are probably aware that fuller ’ s-earth is a valuable product , and that it is only found in one or two places in England ? ’ “ ‘ I have heard so . ’ “ ‘ Some little time ago I bought a small place — a very small place — within ten miles of Reading .
I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller ’ s-earth in one of my fields .
On examining it , however , I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one , and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left — both of them , however , in the grounds of my neighbours .
These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a <unk> .
<unk> , it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value , but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this .
I took a few of my friends into the secret , however , and they suggested that we should quietly and <unk> work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields .
This we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us in our <unk> we erected a hydraulic press .
This press , as I have already explained , has got out of order , and we wish your advice upon the subject .
We guard our secret very <unk> , however , and if it once became known that we had hydraulic <unk> coming to our little house , it would soon <unk> inquiry , and then , if the facts came out , it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans .
That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night .
I hope that I make it all plain ? ’ “ ‘ I quite follow you , ’ said I.
‘ The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in <unk> fuller ’ s-earth , which , as I understand , is <unk> out like <unk> from a pit . ’ “ ‘ Ah ! ’ said he carelessly , ‘ we have our own process .
We compress the earth into bricks , so as to remove them without <unk> what they are .
But that is a mere detail .
I have taken you fully into my confidence now , Mr. Hatherley , and I have shown you how I trust you . ’ He rose as he spoke .
‘ I shall expect you , then , at Eyford at 11 : 15 . ’ “ ‘ I shall certainly be there . ’ “ ‘ And not a word to a soul . ’ He looked at me with a last long , questioning gaze , and then , pressing my hand in a cold , dank grasp , he hurried from the room .
“ Well , when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished , as you may both think , at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me .
On the one hand , of course , I was glad , for the fee was at least <unk> what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services , and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones .
On the other hand , the face and manner of my <unk> had made an unpleasant impression upon me , and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller ’ s-earth was sufficient to explain the <unk> for my coming at midnight , and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand .
However , I threw all fears to the winds , ate a hearty supper , drove to Paddington , and started off , having obeyed to the letter the <unk> as to holding my tongue .
“ At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station .
However , I was in time for the last train to Eyford , and I reached the little <unk> station after eleven o ’ clock .
I was the only <unk> who got out there , and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern .
As I passed out through the <unk> gate , however , I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side .
Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage , the door of which was standing open .
He drew up the windows on either side , tapped on the wood-work , and away we went as fast as the horse could go . ” “ One horse ? ” <unk> Holmes .
“ Yes , only one . ” “ Did you observe the colour ? ” “ Yes , I saw it by the <unk> when I was stepping into the carriage .
It was a chestnut . ” “ <unk> or fresh ? ” “ Oh , fresh and glossy . ” “ Thank you .
I am sorry to have <unk> you .
Pray continue your most interesting statement . ” “ Away we went then , and we drove for at least an hour .
Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles , but I should think , from the rate that we seemed to go , and from the time that we took , that it must have been nearer twelve .
He sat at my side in silence all the time , and I was aware , more than once when I glanced in his direction , that he was looking at me with great <unk> .
The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world , for we <unk> and <unk> terribly .
I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were , but they were made of <unk> glass , and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright <unk> of a passing light .
Now and then I <unk> some remark to break the <unk> of the journey , but the colonel answered only in <unk> , and the conversation soon <unk> .
At last , however , the <unk> of the road was exchanged for the crisp <unk> of a gravel-drive , and the carriage came to a stand .
Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out , and , as I followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a <unk> which gaped in front of us .
We stepped , as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that I failed to catch the most <unk> glance of the front of the house .
The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us , and I heard <unk> the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away .
“ It was pitch dark inside the house , and the colonel <unk> about looking for matches and muttering under his breath .
Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage , and a long , golden bar of light shot out in our direction .
It grew <unk> , and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand , which she held above her head , pushing her face forward and peering at us .
I could see that she was pretty , and from the <unk> with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material .
She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question , and when my companion answered in a <unk> <unk> she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand .
Colonel Stark went up to her , whispered something in her ear , and then , pushing her back into the room from whence she had come , he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand .
“ ‘ Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes , ’ said he , throwing open another door .
It was a quiet , little , plainly furnished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several German books were scattered .
Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a <unk> beside the door .
‘ I shall not keep you waiting an instant , ’ said he , and vanished into the darkness .
“ I glanced at the books upon the table , and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were <unk> on science , the others being <unk> of <unk> .
Then I walked across to the window , <unk> that I might catch some glimpse of the <unk> , but an oak shutter , heavily barred , was folded across it .
It was a wonderfully silent house .
There was an old clock <unk> loudly somewhere in the passage , but otherwise everything was deadly still .
A vague feeling of uneasiness began to <unk> over me .
Who were these German people , and what were they doing living in this strange , <unk> place ?
And where was the place ?
I was ten miles or so from Eyford , that was all I knew , but whether north , south , east , or west I had no idea .
For that matter , Reading , and possibly other large <unk> , were within that radius , so the place might not be so <unk> , after all .
Yet it was quite certain , from the absolute stillness , that we were in the country .
I paced up and down the room , humming a <unk> under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee .
“ Suddenly , without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness , the door of my room swung slowly open .
The woman was standing in the aperture , the darkness of the hall behind her , the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face .
I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear , and the sight sent a chill to my own heart .
She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent , and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me , her eyes glancing back , like those of a frightened horse , into the gloom behind her .
“ ‘ I would go , ’ said she , trying hard , as it seemed to me , to speak calmly ; ‘ I would go .
I should not stay here .
There is no good for you to do . ’ “ ‘ But , madam , ’ said I , ‘ I have not yet done what I came for .
I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine . ’ “ ‘ It is not worth your while to wait , ’ she went on .
‘ You can pass through the door ; no one <unk> . ’ And then , seeing that I smiled and shook my head , she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward , with her hands wrung together .
‘ For the love of Heaven ! ’ she whispered , ‘ get away from here before it is too late ! ’ “ But I am somewhat <unk> by nature , and the more ready to <unk> in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way .
I thought of my fifty-guinea fee , of my <unk> journey , and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me .
Was it all to go for nothing ?
Why should I <unk> away without having carried out my commission , and without the <unk> which was my due ?
This woman might , for all I knew , be a <unk> .
With a stout bearing , therefore , though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess , I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was .
She was about to <unk> her entreaties when a door slammed <unk> , and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs .
She listened for an instant , threw up her hands with a <unk> gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come .
“ The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a <unk> beard growing out of the creases of his double chin , who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson .
“ ‘ This is my <unk> and manager , ’ said the colonel .
‘ By the way , I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now .
I fear that you have felt the draught . ’ “ ‘ On the contrary , ’ said I , ‘ I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close . ’ “ He shot one of his suspicious looks at me .
‘ Perhaps we had better proceed to business , then , ’ said he .
‘ Mr.
Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine . ’ “ ‘ I had better put my hat on , I suppose . ’ “ ‘ Oh , no , it is in the house . ’ “ ‘ What , you <unk> fuller ’ s-earth in the house ? ’ “ ‘ No , no .
This is only where we compress it .
But never mind that .
All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it . ’ “ We went upstairs together , the colonel first with the lamp , the fat manager and I behind him .
It was a labyrinth of an old house , with <unk> , <unk> , narrow winding <unk> , and little low doors , the <unk> of which were <unk> out by the generations who had crossed them .
There were no <unk> and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the plaster was <unk> off the walls , and the damp was breaking through in green , <unk> blotches .
I tried to put on as <unk> an air as possible , but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady , even though I <unk> them , and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions .
Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man , but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a <unk> .
“ Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door , which he unlocked .
Within was a small , square room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time .
Ferguson remained outside , and the colonel ushered me in .
“ ‘ We are now , ’ said he , ‘ actually within the hydraulic press , and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on .
The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending <unk> , and it comes down with the force of many <unk> upon this metal floor .
There are small <unk> columns of water outside which receive the force , and which <unk> and <unk> it in the manner which is familiar to you .
The machine goes readily enough , but there is some <unk> in the working of it , and it has lost a little of its force .
Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right . ’ “ I took the lamp from him , and I examined the machine very thoroughly .
It was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of <unk> enormous pressure .
When I passed outside , however , and pressed down the levers which controlled it , I knew at once by the <unk> sound that there was a slight <unk> , which allowed a <unk> of water through one of the side cylinders .
An examination showed that one of the <unk> bands which was round the head of a <unk> had shrunk so as not quite to fill the <unk> along which it worked .
This was clearly the cause of the loss of power , and I pointed it out to my companions , who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right .
When I had made it clear to them , I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity .
It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller ’ s-earth was the merest <unk> , for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be <unk> for so <unk> a purpose .
The walls were of wood , but the floor consisted of a large iron trough , and when I came to examine it I could see a <unk> of metallic deposit all over it .
I had stooped and was <unk> at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the <unk> face of the colonel looking down at me .
“ ‘ What are you doing there ? ’ he asked .
“ I felt angry at having been <unk> by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me .
‘ I was admiring your fuller ’ s-earth , ’ said I ; ‘ I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used . ’ “ The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the <unk> of my speech .
His face set hard , and a <unk> light sprang up in his grey eyes .
“ ‘ Very well , ’ said he , ‘ you shall know all about the machine . ’ He took a step backward , slammed the little door , and turned the key in the lock .
I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle , but it was quite secure , and did not give in the least to my <unk> and <unk> .
‘ Hullo ! ’ I yelled .
‘ Hullo !
Colonel !
Let me out ! ’ “ And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth .
It was the <unk> of the levers and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
He had set the engine at work .
The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough .
By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me , slowly , <unk> , but , as none knew better than myself , with a force which must within a minute <unk> me to a shapeless <unk> .
I threw myself , screaming , against the door , and dragged with my <unk> at the lock .
I implored the colonel to let me out , but the <unk> <unk> of the levers <unk> my <unk> .
The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head , and with my hand <unk> I could feel its hard , rough surface .
Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it .
If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my <unk> , and I <unk> to think of that dreadful snap .
<unk> the other way , perhaps ; and yet , had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow <unk> down upon me ?
<unk> I was unable to stand erect , when my eye caught something which brought a <unk> of hope back to my heart .
“ I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron , the walls were of wood .
As I gave a last hurried glance around , I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards , which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward .
For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death .
The next instant I threw myself through , and lay <unk> upon the other side .
The panel had closed again behind me , but the crash of the lamp , and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal , told me how narrow had been my escape .
“ I was recalled to myself by a <unk> <unk> at my wrist , and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor , while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand , while she held a candle in her right .
It was the same good friend whose warning I had so <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ Come !
come ! ’ she cried <unk> .
‘ They will be here in a moment .
They will see that you are not there .
Oh , do not waste the <unk> time , but come ! ’ “ This time , at least , I did not <unk> her advice .
I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair .
The latter led to another broad passage , and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices , one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath .
My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit ’ s end .
Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom , through the window of which the moon was shining brightly .
“ ‘ It is your only chance , ’ said she .
‘ It is high , but it may be that you can jump it . ’ “ As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage , and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a <unk> ’ s cleaver in the other .
I rushed across the bedroom , flung open the window , and looked out .
How quiet and sweet and <unk> the garden looked in the moonlight , and it could not be more than thirty feet down .
I <unk> out upon the sill , but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my <unk> and the <unk> who pursued me .
If she were <unk> , then at any <unk> I was determined to go back to her assistance .
The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door , pushing his way past her ; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back .
“ ‘ Fritz !
Fritz ! ’ she cried in English , ‘ remember your promise after the last time .
You said it should not be again .
He will be silent !
Oh , he will be silent ! ’ “ ‘ You are mad , <unk> ! ’ he shouted , struggling to break away from her .
‘ You will be the ruin of us .
He has seen too much .
Let me pass , I say ! ’ He dashed her to one side , and , rushing to the window , cut at me with his heavy weapon .
I had let myself go , and was hanging by the hands to the sill , when his blow fell .
I was conscious of a dull pain , my grip <unk> , and I fell into the garden below .
“ I was shaken but not hurt by the fall ; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run , for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet .
Suddenly , however , as I ran , a deadly <unk> and sickness came over me .
I glanced down at my hand , which was <unk> <unk> , and then , for the first time , saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound .
I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it , but there came a sudden <unk> in my ears , and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes .
“ How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell .
It must have been a very long time , for the moon had sunk , and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself .
My clothes were all sodden with <unk> , and my <unk> was drenched with blood from my <unk> thumb .
The <unk> of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night ’ s adventure , and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my <unk> .
But to my astonishment , when I came to look round me , neither house nor garden were to be seen .
I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad , and just a little lower down was a long building , which proved , upon my approaching it , to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night .
Were it not for the <unk> wound upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream .
“ Half dazed , I went into the station and asked about the morning train .
There would be one to Reading in less than an hour .
The same porter was on duty , I found , as had been there when I arrived .
I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark .
The name was strange to him .
Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me ?
No , he had not .
Was there a police-station anywhere near ?
There was one about three miles off .
“ It was too far for me to go , weak and ill as I was .
I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police .
It was a little past six when I arrived , so I went first to have my wound dressed , and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here .
I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise . ” We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative .
Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the <unk> commonplace books in which he placed his <unk> .
“ Here is an advertisement which will interest you , ” said he .
“ It appeared in all the papers about a year ago .
Listen to this : ‘ <unk> , on the 9th inst . , Mr. <unk> <unk> , <unk> twenty-six , a hydraulic engineer .
<unk> his lodgings at ten o ’ clock at night , and has not been heard of since .
Was dressed in , ’ etc . , etc .
Ha !
That <unk> the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine <unk> , I fancy . ” “ Good heavens ! ” cried my patient .
“ Then that <unk> what the girl said . ” “ Undoubtedly .
It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man , who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game , like those <unk> <unk> who will leave no survivor from a <unk> ship .
Well , every moment now is precious , so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford . ” Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together , bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village .
There were Sherlock Holmes , the hydraulic engineer , Inspector Bradstreet , of Scotland Yard , a plain-clothes man , and myself .
Bradstreet had spread an <unk> map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his <unk> drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre .
“ There you are , ” said he .
“ That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village .
The place we want must be somewhere near that line .
You said ten miles , I think , sir . ” “ It was an hour ’ s good drive . ” “ And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious ? ” “ They must have done so .
I have a confused memory , too , of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere . ” “ What I cannot understand , ” said I , “ is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden .
Perhaps the villain was <unk> by the woman ’ s entreaties . ” “ I hardly think that likely .
I never saw a more inexorable face in my life . ” “ Oh , we shall soon clear up all that , ” said Bradstreet .
“ Well , I have drawn my circle , and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found . ” “ I think I could lay my finger on it , ” said Holmes quietly .
“ Really , now ! ” cried the inspector , “ you have formed your opinion !
Come , now , we shall see who <unk> with you .
I say it is south , for the country is more deserted there . ” “ And I say east , ” said my patient .
“ I am for west , ” remarked the plain-clothes man .
“ There are several quiet little villages up there . ” “ And I am for north , ” said I , “ because there are no hills there , and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any . ” “ Come , ” cried the inspector , laughing ; “ it ’ s a very pretty <unk> of opinion .
We have <unk> the <unk> among us .
Who do you give your <unk> <unk> to ? ” “ You are all wrong . ” “ But we can ’ t all be . ” “ Oh , yes , you can .
This is my point . ” He placed his finger in the centre of the circle .
“ This is where we shall find them . ” “ But the <unk> drive ? ” gasped Hatherley .
“ <unk> out and six back .
Nothing simpler .
You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in .
How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads ? ” “ Indeed , it is a likely <unk> enough , ” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully .
“ Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang . ” “ None at all , ” said Holmes .
“ They are <unk> on a large <unk> , and have used the machine to form the <unk> which has taken the place of silver . ” “ We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work , ” said the inspector .
“ They have been turning out <unk> by the thousand .
We even traced them as far as Reading , but could get no farther , for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands .
But now , thanks to this lucky chance , I think that we have got them right enough . ” But the inspector was mistaken , for those criminals were not <unk> to fall into the hands of justice .
As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense <unk> feather over the <unk> .
“ A house on fire ? ” asked Bradstreet as the train <unk> off again on its way .
“ Yes , sir ! ” said the station-master .
“ When did it break out ? ” “ I hear that it was during the night , sir , but it has got worse , and the whole place is in a blaze . ” “ Whose house is it ? ” “ Dr.
Becher ’ s . ” “ Tell me , ” broke in the engineer , “ is Dr. Becher a German , very thin , with a long , sharp nose ? ” The station-master laughed heartily .
“ No , sir , Dr. Becher is an Englishman , and there isn ’ t a man in the parish who has a <unk> waistcoat .
But he has a gentleman staying with him , a patient , as I understand , who is a <unk> , and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm . ” The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire .
The road <unk> a low <unk> , and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us , <unk> fire at every chink and window , while in the garden in front three <unk> were <unk> <unk> to keep the flames under .
“ That ’ s it ! ” cried Hatherley , in intense excitement .
“ There is the gravel-drive , and there are the rose-bushes where I lay .
That second window is the one that I jumped from . ” “ Well , at least , ” said Holmes , “ you have had your revenge upon them .
There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which , when it was crushed in the press , set fire to the wooden walls , though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time .
Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night , though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now . ” And Holmes ’ fears came to be realised , for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the sinister German , or the morose Englishman .
<unk> that morning a <unk> had met a <unk> containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading , but there all traces of the <unk> disappeared , and even Holmes ’ <unk> failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts .
The <unk> had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within , and still more so by discovering a newly <unk> human thumb upon a <unk> of the second floor .
About <unk> , however , their efforts were at last successful , and they subdued the flames , but not before the roof had fallen in , and the whole place been <unk> to such absolute ruin that , save some twisted cylinders and iron <unk> , not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so <unk> .
Large <unk> of <unk> and of <unk> were discovered stored in an <unk> , but no coins were to be found , which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to .
How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould , which told us a very plain tale .
He had evidently been carried down by two persons , one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other <unk> large ones .
On the whole , it was most probable that the silent Englishman , being less <unk> or less murderous than his companion , had <unk> the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger .
“ Well , ” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London , “ it has been a pretty business for me !
I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee , and what have I gained ? ” “ <unk> , ” said Holmes , laughing .
“ <unk> it may be of value , you know ; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence . ” X.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> <unk> The Lord St. Simon marriage , and its curious <unk> , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom <unk> .
<unk> <unk> have <unk> it , and their more <unk> details have drawn the <unk> away from this <unk> <unk> .
As I have reason to believe , however , that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public , and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up , I feel that no <unk> of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable <unk> .
It was a few weeks before my own marriage , during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street , that he came home from an afternoon <unk> to find a letter on the table waiting for him .
I had remained indoors all day , for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain , with high autumnal winds , and the <unk> <unk> which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a <unk> of my <unk> campaign <unk> with dull persistence .
With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another , I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last , <unk> with the news of the day , I tossed them all aside and lay listless , watching the huge <unk> and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend ’ s noble correspondent could be .
“ Here is a very <unk> epistle , ” I remarked as he entered .
“ Your morning letters , if I remember right , were from a <unk> and a <unk> . ” “ Yes , my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety , ” he answered , smiling , “ and the <unk> are usually the more interesting .
This looks like one of those <unk> social <unk> which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie . ” He broke the seal and glanced over the contents .
“ Oh , come , it may prove to be something of interest , after all . ” “ Not social , then ? ” “ No , distinctly professional . ” “ And from a noble client ? ” “ One of the highest in England . ” “ My dear fellow , I congratulate you . ” “ I assure you , Watson , without <unk> , that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case .
It is just possible , however , that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation .
You have been reading the papers <unk> of late , have you not ? ” “ It looks like it , ” said I ruefully , pointing to a huge bundle in the corner .
“ I have had nothing else to do . ” “ It is fortunate , for you will perhaps be able to post me up .
I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column .
The latter is always instructive .
But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding ? ” “ Oh , yes , with the deepest interest . ” “ That is well .
The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon .
I will read it to you , and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter .
This is what he says : “ ‘ MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES , — Lord Backwater <unk> me that I may place <unk> <unk> upon your judgment and discretion .
I have determined , therefore , to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding .
Mr. Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , is acting already in the matter , but he <unk> me that he sees no objection to your co-operation , and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance .
I will call at four o ’ clock in the afternoon , and , should you have any other engagement at that time , I hope that you will postpone it , as this matter is of <unk> importance .
Yours faithfully , “ ‘ <unk> <unk> . <unk> . ’ “ It is dated from Grosvenor <unk> , written with a <unk> pen , and the noble <unk> has had the misfortune to get a <unk> of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger , ” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle .
“ He says four o ’ clock .
It is three now .
He will be here in an hour . ” “ Then I have just time , with your assistance , to get clear upon the subject .
<unk> over those papers and <unk> the <unk> in their order of time , while I take a glance as to who our client is . ” He picked a <unk> volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece .
“ Here he is , ” said he , sitting down and <unk> it out upon his knee .
“ ‘ Lord Robert <unk> de <unk> St. Simon , second son of the Duke of Balmoral . ’ Hum !
‘ Arms : <unk> , three <unk> in chief over a <unk> <unk> .
Born in <unk> . ’ He ’ s <unk> years of age , which is <unk> for marriage .
Was <unk> for the colonies in a late <unk> .
The Duke , his father , was at one time <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> blood by direct <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> side .
Ha !
Well , there is nothing very instructive in all this .
I think that I must turn to you Watson , for something more solid . ” “ I have very little difficulty in finding what I want , ” said I , “ for the facts are quite recent , and the matter struck me as remarkable .
I feared to <unk> them to you , however , as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you <unk> the intrusion of other matters . ” “ Oh , you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture <unk> .
That is quite cleared up now — though , indeed , it was obvious from the first .
Pray give me the results of your newspaper <unk> . ” “ Here is the first notice which I can find .
It is in the personal column of the _ Morning Post _ , and dates , as you see , some weeks back : ‘ A marriage has been arranged , ’ it says , ‘ and will , if <unk> is correct , very shortly take place , between Lord Robert St. Simon , second son of the Duke of Balmoral , and Miss Hatty Doran , the only daughter of Aloysius Doran .
Esq . , of San Francisco , <unk> . , U.S.A. ’ That is all . ” “ <unk> and to the point , ” remarked Holmes , stretching his long , thin legs towards the fire .
“ There was a paragraph <unk> this in one of the society papers of the same week .
Ah , here it is : ‘ There will soon be a call for <unk> in the marriage market , for the present <unk> <unk> appears to tell heavily against our home product .
One by one the management of the noble houses of Great <unk> is passing into the hands of our fair <unk> from across the Atlantic .
An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the <unk> which have been borne away by these charming <unk> .
Lord St. Simon , who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little <unk> ’ s <unk> , has now <unk> announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran , the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire .
Miss Doran , whose <unk> figure and striking face attracted much attention at the <unk> House <unk> , is an only child , and it is <unk> reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures , with <unk> for the future .
As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years , and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of <unk> , it is obvious that the <unk> heiress is not the only <unk> by an <unk> which will enable her to make the easy and common <unk> from a Republican lady to a British <unk> . ’ ” “ <unk> else ? ” asked Holmes , yawning .
“ Oh , yes ; plenty .
Then there is another note in the _ Morning Post _ to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one , that it would be at St. George ’ s , Hanover Square , that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited , and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran .
Two days later — that is , on Wednesday last — there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place , and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater ’ s place , near <unk> .
Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride . ” “ <unk> the what ? ” asked Holmes with a start .
“ The vanishing of the lady . ” “ When did she vanish , then ? ” “ At the wedding breakfast . ” “ Indeed .
This is more interesting than it promised to be ; quite dramatic , in fact . ” “ Yes ; it struck me as being a little out of the common . ” “ They often vanish before the ceremony , and occasionally during the honeymoon ; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this .
Pray let me have the details . ” “ I warn you that they are very incomplete . ” “ Perhaps we may make them less so . ” “ Such as they are , they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday , which I will read to you .
It is headed , ‘ <unk> <unk> at a <unk> <unk> ’ : “ ‘ The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest <unk> by the strange and painful <unk> which have taken place in connection with his wedding .
The ceremony , as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday , occurred on the previous morning ; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so <unk> floating about .
In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up , so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by <unk> to <unk> what is a common subject for conversation .
“ ‘ The ceremony , which was performed at St. George ’ s , Hanover Square , was a very quiet one , no one being present save the father of the bride , Mr. Aloysius Doran , the Duchess of Balmoral , Lord Backwater , Lord <unk> and Lady <unk> St. Simon ( the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom ) , and Lady <unk> <unk> .
The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran , at Lancaster Gate , where breakfast had been prepared .
It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman , whose name has not been <unk> , who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the <unk> party , <unk> that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon .
It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was <unk> by the butler and the <unk> .
The bride , who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant <unk> , had sat down to breakfast with the rest , when she complained of a sudden <unk> and retired to her room .
Her prolonged absence having caused some <unk> , her father followed her , but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant , caught up an ulster and bonnet , and hurried down to the passage .
One of the <unk> declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus <unk> , but had refused to credit that it was his mistress , <unk> her to be with the company .
On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared , Mr. Aloysius Doran , in <unk> with the bridegroom , instantly put themselves in communication with the police , and very energetic inquiries are being made , which will probably result in a <unk> clearing up of this very singular business .
<unk> to a late hour last night , however , nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady .
There are rumours of foul play in the matter , and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance , in the belief that , from jealousy or some other motive , she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride . ’ ” “ And is that all ? ” “ Only one little item in another of the morning papers , but it is a suggestive one . ” “ And it is — ” “ That Miss Flora Millar , the lady who had caused the disturbance , has actually been arrested .
It appears that she was formerly a _ <unk> _ at the Allegro , and that she has known the bridegroom for some years .
There are no further particulars , and the whole case is in your hands now — so far as it has been set forth in the public press . ” “ And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be .
I would not have missed it for <unk> .
But there is a ring at the bell , Watson , and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four , I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client .
Do not dream of going , Watson , for I very much prefer having a witness , if only as a check to my own memory . ” “ Lord Robert St. Simon , ” announced our <unk> , throwing open the door .
A gentleman entered , with a pleasant , <unk> face , <unk> and pale , with something perhaps of <unk> about the mouth , and with the <unk> , <unk> eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed .
His manner was brisk , and yet his general appearance gave an <unk> impression of age , for he had a slight forward <unk> and a little <unk> of the knees as he walked .
His hair , too , as he swept off his very <unk> hat , was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top .
As to his dress , it was careful to the verge of <unk> , with high collar , black frock-coat , white waistcoat , yellow gloves , <unk> shoes , and <unk> gaiters .
He advanced slowly into the room , turning his head from left to right , and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden <unk> .
“ Good-day , Lord St. Simon , ” said Holmes , rising and bowing .
“ Pray take the basket-chair .
This is my friend and colleague , Dr. Watson .
Draw up a little to the fire , and we will talk this matter over . ” “ A most painful matter to me , as you can most readily imagine , Mr. Holmes .
I have been cut to the quick .
I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort , sir , though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society . ” “ No , I am descending . ” “ I beg pardon . ” “ My last client of the sort was a king . ” “ Oh , really !
I had no idea .
And which king ? ” “ The King of Scandinavia . ” “ What !
Had he lost his wife ? ” “ You can understand , ” said Holmes suavely , “ that I <unk> to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours . ” “ Of course !
Very right !
very right !
I ’ m sure I beg pardon .
As to my own case , I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion . ” “ Thank you .
I have already learned all that is in the public <unk> , nothing more .
I presume that I may take it as correct — this article , for example , as to the disappearance of the bride . ” Lord St. Simon glanced over it .
“ Yes , it is correct , as far as it goes . ” “ But it needs a great deal of <unk> before anyone could offer an opinion .
I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you . ” “ Pray do so . ” “ When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran ? ” “ In San Francisco , a year ago . ” “ You were <unk> in the States ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Did you become engaged then ? ” “ No . ” “ But you were on a friendly footing ? ” “ I was amused by her society , and she could see that I was amused . ” “ Her father is very rich ? ” “ He is said to be the richest man on the <unk> slope . ” “ And how did he make his money ? ” “ In mining .
He had nothing a few years ago .
Then he struck gold , <unk> it , and came up by <unk> and <unk> . ” “ Now , what is your own impression as to the young lady ’ s — your wife ’ s character ? ” The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire .
“ You see , Mr. Holmes , ” said he , “ my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man .
During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or <unk> , so that her education has come from <unk> rather than from the schoolmaster .
She is what we call in England a <unk> , with a strong nature , wild and free , <unk> by any sort of <unk> .
She is <unk> — <unk> , I was about to say .
She is swift in making up her mind and <unk> in carrying out her <unk> .
On the other hand , I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear ” — he gave a little stately <unk> — “ had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman .
I believe that she is capable of <unk> <unk> and that anything <unk> would be <unk> to her . ” “ Have you her photograph ? ” “ I brought this with me . ” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman .
It was not a photograph but an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> had brought out the full effect of the <unk> black hair , the large dark eyes , and the <unk> mouth .
Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it .
Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon .
“ The young lady came to London , then , and you <unk> your acquaintance ? ” “ Yes , her father brought her over for this last London season .
I met her several times , became engaged to her , and have now married her . ” “ She brought , I understand , a considerable dowry ? ” “ A fair dowry .
Not more than is usual in my family . ” “ And this , of course , remains to you , since the marriage is a _ <unk> <unk> _ ? ” “ I really have made no inquiries on the subject . ” “ Very naturally not .
Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Was she in good spirits ? ” “ Never better .
She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives . ” “ Indeed !
That is very interesting .
And on the morning of the wedding ? ” “ She was as bright as possible — at least until after the ceremony . ” “ And did you observe any change in her then ? ” “ Well , to tell the truth , I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp .
The incident however , was too trivial to <unk> and can have no possible bearing upon the case . ” “ Pray let us have it , for all that . ” “ Oh , it is <unk> .
She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the <unk> .
She was passing the front pew at the time , and it fell over into the pew .
There was a moment ’ s delay , but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again , and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall .
Yet when I spoke to her of the matter , she answered me abruptly ; and in the carriage , on our way home , she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause . ” “ Indeed !
You say that there was a gentleman in the pew .
Some of the general public were present , then ? ” “ Oh , yes .
It is impossible to <unk> them when the church is open . ” “ This gentleman was not one of your wife ’ s friends ? ” “ No , no ; I call him a gentleman by courtesy , but he was quite a <unk> person .
I hardly noticed his appearance .
But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point . ” “ Lady St. Simon , then , returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it .
What did she do on <unk> her father ’ s house ? ” “ I saw her in conversation with her maid . ” “ And who is her maid ? ” “ Alice is her name .
She is an American and came from California with her . ” “ A confidential servant ? ” “ A little too much so .
It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great <unk> .
Still , of course , in America they look upon these things in a different way . ” “ How long did she speak to this Alice ? ” “ Oh , a few minutes .
I had something else to think of . ” “ You did not <unk> what they said ? ” “ Lady St. Simon said something about ‘ <unk> a claim . ’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind .
I have no idea what she meant . ” “ American slang is very expressive sometimes .
And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid ? ” “ She walked into the <unk> . ” “ On your arm ? ” “ No , alone .
She was very independent in little matters like that .
Then , after we had sat down for ten minutes or so , she rose hurriedly , muttered some words of apology , and left the room .
She never came back . ” “ But this maid , Alice , as I understand , <unk> that she went to her room , covered her bride ’ s dress with a long ulster , put on a bonnet , and went out . ” “ Quite so .
And she was afterwards seen walking into <unk> Park in company with Flora Millar , a woman who is now in custody , and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran ’ s house that morning . ” “ Ah , yes .
I should like a few particulars as to this young lady , and your relations to her . ” Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows .
“ We have been on a friendly footing for some years — I may say on a _ very _ friendly footing .
She used to be at the Allegro .
I have not treated her <unk> , and she had no just cause of complaint against me , but you know what women are , Mr. Holmes .
Flora was a dear little thing , but exceedingly <unk> and devotedly attached to me .
She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married , and , to tell the truth , the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church .
She came to Mr. Doran ’ s door just after we returned , and she endeavoured to push her way in , <unk> very <unk> <unk> towards my wife , and even <unk> her , but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort , and I had two police <unk> there in private clothes , who soon pushed her out again .
She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row . ” “ Did your wife hear all this ? ” “ No , thank goodness , she did not . ” “ And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards ? ” “ Yes .
That is what Mr. Lestrade , of Scotland Yard , looks upon as so serious .
It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her . ” “ Well , it is a possible <unk> . ” “ You think so , too ? ” “ I did not say a probable one .
But you do not yourself look upon this as likely ? ” “ I do not think Flora would hurt a fly . ” “ Still , jealousy is a strange <unk> of <unk> .
Pray what is your own theory as to what took place ? ” “ Well , really , I came to seek a theory , not to <unk> one .
I have given you all the facts .
<unk> you ask me , however , I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair , the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride , had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife . ” “ In short , that she had become suddenly <unk> ? ” “ Well , really , when I consider that she has turned her back — I will not say upon me , but upon so much that many have <unk> to without success — I can hardly explain it in any other fashion . ” “ Well , certainly that is also a <unk> hypothesis , ” said Holmes , smiling .
“ And now , Lord St. Simon , I think that I have nearly all my data .
May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window ? ” “ We could see the other side of the road and the Park . ” “ Quite so .
Then I do not think that I need to <unk> you longer .
I shall communicate with you . ” “ Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem , ” said our client , rising .
“ I have solved it . ” “ Eh ?
What was that ? ” “ I say that I have solved it . ” “ Where , then , is my wife ? ” “ That is a detail which I shall speedily supply . ” Lord St. Simon shook his head .
“ I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine , ” he remarked , and bowing in a stately , old-fashioned manner he departed .
“ It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own , ” said Sherlock Holmes , laughing .
“ I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this <unk> .
I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room . ” “ My dear Holmes ! ” “ I have notes of several similar cases , though none , as I remarked before , which were quite as prompt .
My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty .
Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing , as when you find a <unk> in the milk , to quote <unk> ’ s example . ” “ But I have heard all that you have heard . ” “ Without , however , the knowledge of <unk> cases which serves me so well .
There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back , and something on very much the same lines at <unk> the year after the <unk> War .
It is one of these cases — but , <unk> , here is Lestrade !
Good-afternoon , Lestrade !
You will find an extra <unk> upon the sideboard , and there are cigars in the box . ” The official detective was <unk> in a pea-jacket and cravat , which gave him a decidedly <unk> appearance , and he carried a black <unk> bag in his hand .
With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him .
“ What ’ s up , then ? ” asked Holmes with a <unk> in his eye .
“ You look dissatisfied . ” “ And I feel dissatisfied .
It is this <unk> St. Simon marriage case .
I can make neither head nor tail of the business . ” “ Really !
You surprise me . ” “ Who ever heard of such a mixed affair ?
Every clue seems to slip through my fingers .
I have been at work upon it all day . ” “ And very wet it seems to have made you , ” said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket .
“ Yes , I have been <unk> the Serpentine . ” “ In Heaven ’ s name , what for ? ” “ In search of the body of Lady St. Simon . ” Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily .
“ Have you dragged the basin of <unk> Square <unk> ? ” he asked .
“ Why ?
What do you mean ? ” “ Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other . ” Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion .
“ I suppose you know all about it , ” he snarled .
“ Well , I have only just heard the facts , but my mind is made up . ” “ Oh , indeed !
Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter ? ” “ I think it very unlikely . ” “ Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it ? ” He opened his bag as he spoke , and <unk> onto the floor a <unk> of <unk> silk , a pair of white <unk> shoes and a bride ’ s <unk> and veil , all discoloured and <unk> in water .
“ There , ” said he , putting a new <unk> upon the top of the pile .
“ There is a little <unk> for you to crack , <unk> Holmes . ” “ Oh , indeed ! ” said my friend , blowing blue rings into the air .
“ You dragged them from the Serpentine ? ” “ No .
They were found floating near the <unk> by a <unk> .
They have been identified as her clothes , and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off . ” “ By the same brilliant reasoning , every man ’ s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe .
And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this ? ” “ At some evidence <unk> Flora Millar in the disappearance . ” “ I am afraid that you will find it difficult . ” “ Are you , indeed , now ? ” cried Lestrade with some <unk> .
“ I am afraid , Holmes , that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences .
You have made two <unk> in as many minutes .
This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar . ” “ And how ? ” “ In the dress is a pocket .
In the pocket is a card-case .
In the card-case is a note .
And here is the very note . ” He <unk> it down upon the table in front of him .
“ Listen to this : ‘ You will see me when all is ready .
Come at once .
<unk> H. <unk> ’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar , and that she , with <unk> , no doubt , was responsible for her disappearance .
Here , signed with her initials , is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which <unk> her within their reach . ” “ Very good , Lestrade , ” said Holmes , laughing .
“ You really are very fine indeed .
Let me see it . ” He took up the paper in a listless way , but his attention instantly became <unk> , and he gave a little cry of satisfaction .
“ This is indeed important , ” said he .
“ Ha !
you find it so ? ” “ <unk> so .
I congratulate you warmly . ” Lestrade rose in his <unk> and bent his head to look .
“ Why , ” he shrieked , “ you ’ re looking at the wrong side ! ” “ On the contrary , this is the right side . ” “ The right side ?
You ’ re mad !
Here is the note written in pencil over here . ” “ And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill , which interests me deeply . ” “ There ’ s nothing in it .
I looked at it before , ” said Lestrade .
“ ‘ <unk>
4th , rooms 8 _ s _ . , breakfast 2 _ s _ .
6 _ d _ . , <unk> 1 _ s _ . , lunch 2 _ s _ .
6 _ d _ . , glass sherry , 8 _ d _ . ’ I see nothing in that . ” “ Very likely not .
It is most important , all the same .
As to the note , it is important also , or at least the initials are , so I congratulate you again . ” “ I ’ ve wasted time enough , ” said Lestrade , rising .
“ I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories .
Good-day , Mr. Holmes , and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first . ” He gathered up the garments , thrust them into the bag , and made for the door .
“ Just one hint to you , Lestrade , ” <unk> Holmes before his <unk> vanished ; “ I will tell you the true solution of the matter .
Lady St. Simon is a <unk> .
There is not , and there never has been , any such person . ” Lestrade looked <unk> at my companion .
Then he turned to me , tapped his forehead three times , shook his head solemnly , and hurried away .
He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat .
“ There is something in what the fellow says about <unk> work , ” he remarked , “ so I think , Watson , that I must leave you to your papers for a little . ” It was after five o ’ clock when Sherlock Holmes left me , but I had no time to be lonely , for within an hour there arrived a <unk> ’ s man with a very large flat box .
This he <unk> with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him , and presently , to my very great astonishment , a quite <unk> little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble <unk> <unk> .
There were a couple of <unk> of cold woodcock , a <unk> , a _ <unk> de <unk> <unk> _ <unk> with a group of <unk> and <unk> bottles .
Having laid out all these <unk> , my two visitors vanished away , like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address .
Just before nine o ’ clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room .
His features were gravely set , but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions .
“ They have laid the supper , then , ” he said , rubbing his hands .
“ You seem to expect company .
They have laid for five . ” “ Yes , I fancy we may have some company dropping in , ” said he .
“ I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived .
Ha !
I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs . ” It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came <unk> in , dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever , and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features .
“ My <unk> reached you , then ? ” asked Holmes .
“ Yes , and I confess that the contents startled me beyond <unk> .
Have you good <unk> for what you say ? ” “ The best possible . ” Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead .
“ What will the Duke say , ” he murmured , “ when he hears that one of the family has been <unk> to such humiliation ? ” “ It is the <unk> accident .
I cannot allow that there is any humiliation . ” “ Ah , you look on these things from another <unk> . ” “ I fail to see that anyone is to blame .
I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise , though her <unk> method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted .
Having no mother , she had no one to advise her at such a crisis . ” “ It was a slight , sir , a public slight , ” said Lord St. Simon , tapping his fingers upon the table .
“ You must make allowance for this poor girl , placed in so <unk> a position . ” “ I will make no allowance .
I am very angry indeed , and I have been shamefully used . ” “ I think that I heard a ring , ” said Holmes .
“ Yes , there are steps on the <unk> .
If I cannot persuade you to take a <unk> view of the matter , Lord St. Simon , I have brought an <unk> here who may be more successful . ” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman .
“ Lord St. Simon , ” said he “ allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis <unk> Moulton .
The lady , I think , you have already met . ” At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect , with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat , a picture of offended dignity .
The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him , but he still refused to raise his eyes .
It was as well for his resolution , perhaps , for her <unk> face was one which it was hard to resist .
“ You ’ re angry , Robert , ” said she .
“ Well , I guess you have every cause to be . ” “ Pray make no apology to me , ” said Lord St. Simon bitterly .
“ Oh , yes , I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went ; but I was kind of rattled , and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn ’ t know what I was doing or saying .
I only wonder I didn ’ t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar . ” “ Perhaps , Mrs. Moulton , you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter ? ” “ If I may give an opinion , ” remarked the strange gentleman , “ we ’ ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already .
For my part , I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it . ” He was a small , <unk> , <unk> man , clean-shaven , with a sharp face and <unk> manner .
“ Then I ’ ll tell our story right away , ” said the lady .
“ Frank here and I met in ’ 84 , in <unk> ’ s camp , near the <unk> , where Pa was working a claim .
We were engaged to each other , Frank and I ; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile , while poor Frank here had a claim that <unk> out and came to nothing .
The richer Pa grew the <unk> was Frank ; so at last Pa wouldn ’ t hear of our engagement <unk> any longer , and he took me away to ’ Frisco .
Frank wouldn ’ t throw up his hand , though ; so he followed me there , and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it .
It would only have made him mad to know , so we just fixed it all up for ourselves .
Frank said that he would go and make his pile , too , and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa .
So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived .
‘ Why <unk> ’ t we be married right away , then , ’ said he , ‘ and then I will feel sure of you ; and I won ’ t claim to be your husband until I come back ? ’ Well , we talked it over , and he had fixed it all up so nicely , with a clergyman all ready in waiting , that we just did it right there ; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune , and I went back to Pa . “ The next I heard of Frank was that he was in <unk> , and then he went <unk> in <unk> , and then I heard of him from New <unk> .
After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners ’ camp had been attacked by <unk> <unk> , and there was my Frank ’ s name among the killed .
I fainted dead away , and I was very sick for months after .
Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’ Frisco .
Not a word of news came for a year and more , so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead .
Then Lord St. Simon came to ’ Frisco , and we came to London , and a marriage was arranged , and Pa was very pleased , but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank .
“ Still , if I had married Lord St. Simon , of course I ’ d have done my duty by him .
We can ’ t command our love , but we can our actions .
I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be .
But you may imagine what I felt when , just as I came to the altar <unk> , I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew .
I thought it was his <unk> at first ; but when I looked again there he was still , with a kind of question in his eyes , as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him .
I wonder I didn ’ t drop .
I know that everything was turning round , and the words of the clergyman were just like the <unk> of a <unk> in my ear .
I didn ’ t know what to do .
Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church ?
I glanced at him again , and he seemed to know what I was thinking , for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still .
Then I saw him <unk> on a piece of paper , and I knew that he was writing me a note .
As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him , and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers .
It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so .
Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him , and I determined to do just whatever he might direct .
“ When I got back I told my maid , who had known him in California , and had always been his friend .
I ordered her to say nothing , but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready .
I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon , but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people .
I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards .
I hadn ’ t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road .
He <unk> to me and then began walking into the Park .
I slipped out , put on my things , and followed him .
Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me — seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also — but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank .
We got into a cab together , and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square , and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting .
Frank had been a prisoner among the <unk> , had escaped , came on to ’ Frisco , found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England , followed me there , and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding . ” “ I saw it in a paper , ” explained the American .
“ It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived . ” “ Then we had a talk as to what we should do , and Frank was all for <unk> , but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again — just sending a line to Pa , perhaps , to show him that I was alive .
It was awful to me to think of all those <unk> and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back .
So Frank took my <unk> and things and made a bundle of them , so that I should not be traced , and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them .
It is likely that we should have gone on to <unk> to-morrow , only that this good gentleman , Mr. Holmes , came round to us this evening , though how he found us is more than I can think , and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right , and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret .
Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone , and so we came right away round to his rooms at once .
Now , Robert , you have heard it all , and I am very sorry if I have given you pain , and I hope that you do not think very <unk> of me . ” Lord St. Simon had by no means <unk> his rigid attitude , but had listened with a <unk> brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative .
“ Excuse me , ” he said , “ but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner . ” “ Then you won ’ t forgive me ?
You won ’ t shake hands before I go ? ” “ Oh , certainly , if it would give you any pleasure . ” He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him .
“ I had hoped , ” suggested Holmes , “ that you would have joined us in a friendly supper . ” “ I think that there you ask a little too much , ” responded his <unk> .
“ I may be forced to <unk> in these recent <unk> , but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them .
I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night . ” He included us all in a sweeping bow and <unk> out of the room .
“ Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company , ” said Sherlock Holmes .
“ It is always a joy to meet an American , Mr. Moulton , for I am one of those who believe that the <unk> of a <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> in <unk> years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same <unk> country under a <unk> which shall be a <unk> of the Union Jack with the <unk> and <unk> . ” “ The case has been an interesting one , ” remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us , “ because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable .
Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as <unk> by this lady , and nothing stranger than the result when viewed , for instance , by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard . ” “ You were not yourself at fault at all , then ? ” “ From the first , two facts were very obvious to me , the one that the lady had been quite willing to <unk> the wedding ceremony , the other that she had <unk> of it within a few minutes of returning home .
Obviously something had occurred during the morning , then , to cause her to change her mind .
What could that something be ?
She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out , for she had been in the company of the bridegroom .
Had she seen someone , then ?
If she had , it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to <unk> so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely .
You see we have already arrived , by a process of exclusion , at the idea that she might have seen an American .
Then who could this American be , and why should he possess so much influence over her ?
It might be a lover ; it might be a husband .
Her young <unk> had , I knew , been spent in rough <unk> and under strange conditions .
So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon ’ s narrative .
When he told us of a man in a pew , of the change in the bride ’ s manner , of so transparent a <unk> for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet , of her <unk> to her confidential maid , and of her very <unk> allusion to <unk> — which in miners ’ <unk> means taking possession of that which another person has a <unk> claim to — the whole situation became absolutely clear .
She had gone off with a man , and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband — the chances being in favour of the latter . ” “ And how in the world did you find them ? ” “ It might have been difficult , but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know .
The initials were , of course , of the highest importance , but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels . ” “ How did you deduce the select ? ” “ By the select prices .
Eight shillings for a bed and <unk> for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels .
There are not many in London which charge at that rate .
In the second one which I visited in <unk> Avenue , I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton , an American gentleman , had left only the day before , and on looking over the entries against him , I came upon the very <unk> which I had seen in the <unk> bill .
His letters were to be <unk> to <unk> Gordon Square ; so <unk> I travelled , and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home , I ventured to give them some <unk> advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular .
I invited them to meet him here , and , as you see , I made him keep the appointment . ” “ But with no very good result , ” I remarked .
“ His conduct was certainly not very gracious . ” “ Ah , Watson , ” said Holmes , smiling , “ perhaps you would not be very gracious either , if , after all the trouble of wooing and wedding , you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune .
I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very <unk> and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position .
Draw your chair up and hand me my violin , for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these <unk> autumnal evenings . ” XI .
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> <unk> “ Holmes , ” said I as I stood one morning in our <unk> looking down the street , “ here is a <unk> coming along .
It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone . ” My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown , looking over my shoulder .
It was a bright , crisp February morning , and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground , <unk> brightly in the <unk> sun .
<unk> the centre of Baker Street it had been <unk> into a brown <unk> band by the traffic , but at either side and on the <unk> edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell .
The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped , but was still <unk> <unk> , so that there were fewer <unk> than usual .
Indeed , from the direction of the <unk> Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention .
He was a man of about fifty , tall , portly , and <unk> , with a massive , strongly marked face and a <unk> figure .
He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style , in black frock-coat , shining hat , neat brown gaiters , and <unk> <unk> trousers .
Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features , for he was running hard , with occasional little <unk> , such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs .
As he ran he jerked his hands up and down , <unk> his head , and writhed his face into the most extraordinary <unk> .
“ What on earth can be the matter with him ? ” I asked .
“ He is looking up at the numbers of the houses . ” “ I believe that he is coming here , ” said Holmes , rubbing his hands .
“ Here ? ” “ Yes ; I rather think he is coming to consult me <unk> .
I think that I recognise the symptoms .
Ha !
did I not tell you ? ” As he spoke , the man , puffing and blowing , rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house <unk> with the clanging .
A few moments later he was in our room , still puffing , still <unk> , but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our <unk> were turned in an instant to horror and pity .
For a while he could not get his words out , but <unk> his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason .
Then , suddenly springing to his feet , he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room .
Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and , sitting beside him , patted his hand and <unk> with him in the easy , soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ .
“ You have come to me to tell your story , have you not ? ” said he .
“ You are <unk> with your haste .
Pray wait until you have recovered yourself , and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me . ” The man sat for a minute or more with a <unk> chest , <unk> against his emotion .
Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow , set his lips <unk> , and turned his face towards us .
“ No doubt you think me mad ? ” said he .
“ I see that you have had some great trouble , ” responded Holmes .
“ God knows I have ! — a trouble which is enough to <unk> my reason , so sudden and so terrible is it .
<unk> disgrace I might have faced , although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain .
<unk> <unk> also is the lot of every man ; but the two coming together , and in so <unk> a form , have been enough to shake my very soul .
Besides , it is not I alone .
The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair . ” “ Pray <unk> yourself , sir , ” said Holmes , “ and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has <unk> you . ” “ My name , ” answered our visitor , “ is probably familiar to your ears .
I am <unk> Holder , of the banking firm of Holder &amp; <unk> , of Threadneedle Street . ” The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London .
What could have happened , then , to bring one of the <unk> citizens of London to this most pitiable pass ?
We waited , all curiosity , until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story .
“ I feel that time is of value , ” said he ; “ that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation .
I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot , for the cabs go slowly through this snow .
That is why I was so out of breath , for I am a man who takes very little exercise .
I feel better now , and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can .
“ It is , of course , well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find <unk> investments for our <unk> as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our <unk> .
One of our most <unk> means of laying out money is in the shape of <unk> , where the security is unimpeachable .
We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years , and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures , <unk> , or plate .
“ Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks .
I started when I saw the name , for it was that of none other than — well , perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth — one of the highest , noblest , most exalted names in England .
I was <unk> by the honour and attempted , when he entered , to say so , but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task .
“ ‘ Mr.
Holder , ’ said he , ‘ I have been informed that you are in the habit of <unk> money . ’ “ ‘ The firm does so when the security is good . ’ I answered .
“ ‘ It is absolutely essential to me , ’ said he , ‘ that I should have £ <unk> at once .
I could , of course , <unk> so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends , but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself .
In my position you can readily understand that it is <unk> to place one ’ s self under obligations . ’ “ ‘ For how long , may I ask , do you want this sum ? ’ I asked .
“ ‘ Next Monday I have a large sum due to me , and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance , with whatever interest you think it right to charge .
But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once . ’ “ ‘ I should be happy to advance it without further <unk> from my own private purse , ’ said I , ‘ were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear .
If , on the other hand , I am to do it in the name of the firm , then in justice to my partner I must insist that , even in your case , every <unk> precaution should be taken . ’ “ ‘ I should much prefer to have it so , ’ said he , raising up a square , black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair .
‘ You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet ? ’ “ ‘ One of the most precious public <unk> of the <unk> , ’ said I.
“ ‘ Precisely . ’ He opened the case , and there , <unk> in soft , flesh-coloured velvet , lay the magnificent piece of <unk> which he had named .
‘ There are thirty-nine enormous beryls , ’ said he , ‘ and the price of the gold <unk> is <unk> .
The lowest <unk> would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked .
I am prepared to leave it with you as my security . ’ “ I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my <unk> client .
“ ‘ You doubt its value ? ’ he asked .
“ ‘ Not at all .
I only doubt — ’ “ ‘ The propriety of my leaving it .
You may set your mind at rest about that .
I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to <unk> it .
It is a pure matter of form .
Is the security sufficient ? ’ “ ‘ Ample . ’ “ ‘ You understand , Mr. Holder , that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you , founded upon all that I have heard of you .
I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to <unk> from all gossip upon the matter but , above all , to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it .
Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss , for there are no beryls in the world to match these , and it would be impossible to replace them .
I leave it with you , however , with every confidence , and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning . ’ “ Seeing that my client was anxious to leave , I said no more but , calling for my cashier , I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes .
When I was alone once more , however , with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me , I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense <unk> which it <unk> upon me .
There could be no doubt that , as it was a national possession , a horrible scandal would <unk> if any misfortune should occur to it .
I already regretted having ever <unk> to take charge of it .
However , it was too late to <unk> the matter now , so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work .
“ When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me .
<unk> ’ <unk> had been forced before now , and why should not mine be ?
If so , how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself !
I determined , therefore , that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me , so that it might never be really out of my reach .
With this intention , I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham , carrying the jewel with me .
I did not <unk> freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room .
“ And now a word as to my household , Mr. Holmes , for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation .
My groom and my page sleep out of the house , and may be set aside altogether .
I have three <unk> who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute <unk> is quite above suspicion .
<unk> , Lucy Parr , the second waiting-maid , has only been in my service a few months .
She came with an excellent character , however , and has always given me satisfaction .
She is a very pretty girl and has attracted <unk> who have occasionally hung about the place .
That is the only drawback which we have found to her , but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way .
“ So much for the servants .
My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it .
I am a widower and have an only son , Arthur .
He has been a disappointment to me , Mr. Holmes — a <unk> disappointment .
I have no doubt that I am myself to blame .
<unk> tell me that I have spoiled him .
Very likely I have .
When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love .
I could not bear to see the smile <unk> even for a moment from his face .
I have never denied him a wish .
Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been <unk> , but I meant it for the best .
“ It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business , but he was not of a business turn .
He was wild , <unk> , and , to speak the truth , I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money .
When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club , and there , having charming manners , he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long <unk> and expensive habits .
He learned to play heavily at cards and to <unk> money on the <unk> , until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance , that he might settle his debts of honour .
He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping , but each time the influence of his friend , Sir George Burnwell , was enough to draw him back again .
“ And , indeed , I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him , for he has frequently brought him to my house , and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the <unk> of his manner .
He is older than Arthur , a man of the world to his finger-tips , one who had been <unk> , seen everything , a brilliant <unk> , and a man of great personal beauty .
Yet when I think of him in cold blood , far away from the <unk> of his presence , I am convinced from his <unk> speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply <unk> .
So I think , and so , too , thinks my little Mary , who has a woman ’ s quick insight into character .
“ And now there is only she to be described .
She is my niece ; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her , and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter .
She is a <unk> in my house — sweet , loving , beautiful , a wonderful manager and housekeeper , yet as <unk> and quiet and gentle as a woman could be .
She is my right hand .
I do not know what I could do without her .
In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes .
Twice my boy has asked her to marry him , for he loves her devotedly , but each time she has refused him .
I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she , and that his marriage might have changed his whole life ; but now , <unk> !
it is too late — forever too late !
“ Now , Mr. Holmes , you know the people who live under my roof , and I shall continue with my miserable story .
“ When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner , I told Arthur and Mary my experience , and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof , <unk> only the name of my client .
Lucy Parr , who had brought in the coffee , had , I am sure , left the room ; but I cannot swear that the door was closed .
Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet , but I thought it better not to disturb it .
“ ‘ Where have you put it ? ’ asked Arthur .
“ ‘ In my own bureau . ’ “ ‘ Well , I hope to goodness the house won ’ t be burgled during the night . ’ said he .
“ ‘ It is locked up , ’ I answered .
“ ‘ Oh , any old key will fit that bureau .
When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the <unk> cupboard . ’ “ He often had a wild way of talking , so that I thought little of what he said .
He followed me to my room , however , that night with a very grave face .
“ ‘ Look here , dad , ’ said he with his eyes cast down , ‘ can you let me have £ <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ No , I cannot ! ’ I answered sharply .
‘ I have been far too <unk> with you in money matters . ’ “ ‘ You have been very kind , ’ said he , ‘ but I must have this money , or else I can never show my face inside the club again . ’ “ ‘ And a very good thing , too ! ’ I cried .
“ ‘ Yes , but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man , ’ said he .
‘ I could not bear the disgrace .
I must raise the money in some way , and if you will not let me have it , then I must try other means . ’ “ I was very angry , for this was the third demand during the month .
‘ You shall not have a <unk> from me , ’ I cried , on which he bowed and left the room without another word .
“ When he was gone I unlocked my bureau , made sure that my treasure was safe , and locked it again .
Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure — a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night .
As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall , which she closed and fastened as I approached .
“ ‘ Tell me , dad , ’ said she , looking , I thought , a little disturbed , ‘ did you give Lucy , the maid , leave to go out to-night ? ’ “ ‘ Certainly not . ’ “ ‘ She came in just now by the back door .
I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone , but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped . ’ “ ‘ You must speak to her in the morning , or I will if you prefer it .
Are you sure that everything is fastened ? ’ “ ‘ Quite sure , dad . ’ “ ‘ Then , good-night . ’ I <unk> her and went up to my bedroom again , where I was soon asleep .
“ I am endeavouring to tell you everything , Mr. Holmes , which may have any bearing upon the case , but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear . ” “ On the contrary , your statement is <unk> <unk> . ” “ I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so .
I am not a very heavy sleeper , and the anxiety in my mind <unk> , no doubt , to make me even less so than usual .
About two in the morning , then , I was awakened by some sound in the house .
It had ceased <unk> I was wide awake , but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere .
I lay listening with all my ears .
Suddenly , to my horror , there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room .
I slipped out of bed , all palpitating with fear , and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door .
“ ‘ Arthur ! ’ I screamed , ‘ you villain !
you thief !
How dare you touch that coronet ? ’ “ The gas was half up , as I had left it , and my unhappy boy , dressed only in his shirt and trousers , was standing beside the light , holding the coronet in his hands .
He appeared to be <unk> at it , or bending it with all his strength .
At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death .
I snatched it up and examined it .
One of the gold corners , with three of the beryls in it , was missing .
“ ‘ You <unk> ! ’ I shouted , beside myself with rage .
‘ You have destroyed it !
You have dishonoured me forever !
Where are the jewels which you have stolen ? ’ “ ‘ Stolen ! ’ he cried .
“ ‘ Yes , thief ! ’ I roared , shaking him by the shoulder .
“ ‘ There are none missing .
There cannot be any missing , ’ said he .
“ ‘ There are three missing .
And you know where they are .
<unk> I call you a <unk> as well as a thief ?
Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece ? ’ “ ‘ You have called me names enough , ’ said he , ‘ I will not stand it any longer .
I shall not say another word about this business , since you have chosen to insult me .
I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world . ’ “ ‘ You shall leave it in the hands of the police ! ’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage .
‘ I shall have this matter probed to the bottom . ’ “ ‘ You shall learn nothing from me , ’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature .
‘ If you choose to call the police , let the police find what they can . ’ “ By this time the whole house was <unk> , for I had raised my voice in my anger .
Mary was the first to rush into my room , and , at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur ’ s face , she read the whole story and , with a scream , fell down senseless on the ground .
I sent the <unk> for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once .
When the inspector and a constable entered the house , Arthur , who had stood <unk> with his arms folded , asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with <unk> .
I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter , but had become a public one , since the ruined coronet was national property .
I was determined that the law should have its way in everything .
“ ‘ At least , ’ said he , ‘ you will not have me arrested at once .
It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes . ’ “ ‘ That you may get away , or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen , ’ said I.
And then , realising the dreadful position in which I was placed , I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake ; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would <unk> the <unk> .
He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones .
“ ‘ You may as well face the matter , ’ said I ; ‘ you have been caught in the act , and no confession could make your guilt more <unk> .
If you but make such <unk> as is in your power , by telling us where the beryls are , all shall be <unk> and forgotten . ’ “ ‘ <unk> your forgiveness for those who ask for it , ’ he answered , turning away from me with a sneer .
I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him .
There was but one way for it .
I called in the inspector and gave him into custody .
A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems ; but no trace of them could be found , nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our <unk> and our <unk> .
This morning he was removed to a cell , and I , after going through all the police <unk> , have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in <unk> the matter .
The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it .
You may go to any expense which you think necessary .
I have already offered a reward of £ 1000 .
My God , what shall I do !
I have lost my honour , my gems , and my son in one night .
Oh , what shall I do ! ” He put a hand on either side of his head and <unk> himself to and fro , <unk> to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words .
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes , with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire .
“ Do you receive much company ? ” he asked .
“ None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur ’ s .
Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately .
No one else , I think . ” “ Do you go out much in society ? ” “ Arthur does .
Mary and I stay at home .
We neither of us care for it . ” “ That is unusual in a young girl . ” “ She is of a quiet nature .
Besides , she is not so very young .
She is <unk> . ” “ This matter , from what you say , seems to have been a shock to her also . ” “ <unk> !
She is even more affected than I. ” “ You have neither of you any doubt as to your son ’ s guilt ? ” “ How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands . ” “ I hardly consider that a conclusive proof .
Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured ? ” “ Yes , it was twisted . ” “ Do you not think , then , that he might have been trying to straighten it ? ” “ God bless you !
You are doing what you can for him and for me .
But it is too heavy a task .
What was he doing there at all ?
If his purpose were innocent , why did he not say so ? ” “ Precisely .
And if it were guilty , why did he not invent a lie ?
His silence appears to me to cut both ways .
There are several singular points about the case .
What did the police think of the noise which <unk> you from your sleep ? ” “ They considered that it might be caused by Arthur ’ s closing his bedroom door . ” “ A likely story !
As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household .
What did they say , then , of the disappearance of these gems ? ” “ They are still <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the furniture in the hope of finding them . ” “ Have they thought of looking outside the house ? ” “ Yes , they have shown extraordinary energy .
The whole garden has already been minutely examined . ” “ Now , my dear sir , ” said Holmes , “ is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think ?
It appeared to you to be a simple case ; to me it seems exceedingly complex .
<unk> what is <unk> by your theory .
You suppose that your son came down from his bed , went , at great risk , to your dressing-room , opened your bureau , took out your coronet , broke off by main force a small portion of it , went off to some other place , concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine , with such skill that <unk> can find them , and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered .
I ask you now , is such a theory <unk> ? ” “ But what other is there ? ” cried the banker with a gesture of despair .
“ If his motives were innocent , why does he not explain them ? ” “ It is our task to find that out , ” replied Holmes ; “ so now , if you please , Mr. Holder , we will set off for Streatham together , and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details . ” My friend insisted upon my <unk> them in their expedition , which I was eager enough to do , for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply <unk> by the story to which we had listened .
I confess that the guilt of the banker ’ s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father , but still I had such faith in Holmes ’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation .
He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern <unk> , but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes , sunk in the deepest thought .
Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him , and he even broke into a <unk> chat with me over his business affairs .
A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank , the <unk> residence of the great financier .
Fairbank was a <unk> square house of white stone , standing back a little from the road .
A double <unk> , with a <unk> lawn , stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance .
On the right side was a small wooden <unk> , which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door , and forming the tradesmen ’ s entrance .
On the left ran a lane which led to the <unk> , and was not itself within the grounds at all , being a public , though little used , thoroughfare .
Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house , across the front , down the tradesmen ’ s path , and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane .
So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return .
We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in .
She was rather above the middle height , slim , with dark hair and eyes , which seemed the darker against the absolute <unk> of her skin .
I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly <unk> in a woman ’ s face .
Her lips , too , were bloodless , but her eyes were flushed with <unk> .
As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning , and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character , with immense capacity for self-restraint .
<unk> my presence , she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly <unk> .
“ You have given orders that Arthur should be <unk> , have you not , dad ? ” she asked .
“ No , no , my girl , the matter must be probed to the bottom . ” “ But I am so sure that he is innocent .
You know what woman ’ s instincts are .
I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so <unk> . ” “ Why is he silent , then , if he is innocent ? ” “ Who knows ?
Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him . ” “ How could I help suspecting him , when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand ? ” “ Oh , but he had only picked it up to look at it .
Oh , do , do take my word for it that he is innocent .
Let the matter drop and say no more .
It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison ! ” “ I shall never let it drop until the gems are found — never , Mary !
Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful <unk> to me .
Far from <unk> the thing up , I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it . ” “ This gentleman ? ” she asked , <unk> round to me .
“ No , his friend .
He wished us to leave him alone .
He is round in the stable lane now . ” “ The stable lane ? ” She raised her dark eyebrows .
“ What can he hope to find there ?
Ah !
this , I suppose , is he .
I trust , sir , that you will succeed in <unk> , what I feel sure is the truth , that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime . ” “ I fully share your opinion , and I trust , with you , that we may prove it , ” returned Holmes , going back to the <unk> to knock the snow from his shoes .
“ I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder .
Might I ask you a question or two ? ” “ Pray do , sir , if it may help to clear this horrible affair up . ” “ You heard nothing yourself last night ? ” “ Nothing , until my uncle here began to speak loudly .
I heard that , and I came down . ” “ You shut up the windows and doors the night before .
Did you <unk> all the windows ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Were they all fastened this morning ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You have a maid who has a sweetheart ?
I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him ? ” “ Yes , and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room , and who may have heard uncle ’ s remarks about the coronet . ” “ I see .
You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart , and that the two may have <unk> the robbery . ” “ But what is the good of all these vague theories , ” cried the banker impatiently , “ when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands ? ” “ Wait a little , Mr. Holder .
We must come back to that .
About this girl , Miss Holder .
You saw her return by the kitchen door , I presume ? ” “ Yes ; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in .
I saw the man , too , in the gloom . ” “ Do you know him ? ” “ Oh , yes !
he is the <unk> who brings our vegetables round .
His name is Francis <unk> . ” “ He stood , ” said Holmes , “ to the left of the door — that is to say , farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door ? ” “ Yes , he did . ” “ And he is a man with a wooden leg ? ” <unk> like fear sprang up in the young lady ’ s expressive black eyes .
“ Why , you are like a <unk> , ” said she .
“ How do you know that ? ” She smiled , but there was no answering smile in Holmes ’ thin , eager face .
“ I should be very glad now to go upstairs , ” said he .
“ I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again .
Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up . ” He walked swiftly round from one to the other , <unk> only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane .
This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens .
“ Now we shall go upstairs , ” said he at last .
The banker ’ s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber , with a grey carpet , a large bureau , and a long mirror .
Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock .
“ Which key was used to open it ? ” he asked .
“ That which my son himself indicated — that of the cupboard of the lumber-room . ” “ Have you it here ? ” “ That is it on the dressing-table . ” Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau .
“ It is a noiseless lock , ” said he .
“ It is no wonder that it did not wake you .
This case , I presume , contains the coronet .
We must have a look at it . ” He opened the case , and taking out the <unk> he laid it upon the table .
It was a magnificent specimen of the <unk> ’ s art , and the thirty-six stones were the <unk> that I have ever seen .
At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge , where a corner holding three gems had been torn away .
“ Now , Mr. Holder , ” said Holmes , “ here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost .
Might I beg that you will break it off . ” The banker <unk> in horror .
“ I should not dream of trying , ” said he .
“ Then I will . ” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it , but without result .
“ I feel it give a little , ” said he ; “ but , though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers , it would take me all my time to break it .
An ordinary man could not do it .
Now , what do you think would happen if I did break it , Mr. Holder ?
There would be a noise like a pistol shot .
Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it ? ” “ I do not know what to think .
It is all dark to me . ” “ But perhaps it may grow <unk> as we go .
What do you think , Miss Holder ? ” “ I confess that I still share my uncle ’ s perplexity . ” “ Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him ? ” “ He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt . ” “ Thank you .
We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry , and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up .
With your permission , Mr. Holder , I shall now continue my investigations outside . ” He went alone , at his own request , for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult .
For an hour or more he was at work , returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as <unk> as ever .
“ I think that I have seen now all that there is to see , Mr. Holder , ” said he ; “ I can serve you best by returning to my rooms . ” “ But the gems , Mr. Holmes .
Where are they ? ” “ I cannot tell . ” The banker wrung his hands .
“ I shall never see them again ! ” he cried .
“ And my son ?
You give me hopes ? ” “ My opinion is in no way <unk> . ” “ Then , for God ’ s sake , what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night ? ” “ If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer .
I understand that you give me _ carte blanche _ to act for you , provided only that I get back the gems , and that you place no <unk> on the sum I may draw . ” “ I would give my fortune to have them back . ” “ Very good .
I shall look into the matter between this and then .
Good-bye ; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening . ” It was obvious to me that my companion ’ s mind was now made up about the case , although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine .
<unk> times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point , but he always glided away to some other <unk> , until at last I gave it over in despair .
It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more .
He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer .
With his collar turned up , his shiny , seedy coat , his red cravat , and his worn boots , he was a perfect sample of the class .
“ I think that this should do , ” said he , glancing into the glass above the fireplace .
“ I only wish that you could come with me , Watson , but I fear that it won ’ t do .
I may be on the <unk> in this matter , or I may be following a <unk> ’ <unk> , but I shall soon know which it is .
I hope that I may be back in a few hours . ” He cut a <unk> of beef from the <unk> upon the sideboard , sandwiched it between two <unk> of <unk> , and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition .
I had just finished my tea when he returned , evidently in excellent spirits , swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand .
He <unk> it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea .
“ I only looked in as I passed , ” said he .
“ I am going right on . ” “ Where to ? ” “ Oh , to the other side of the West End .
It may be some time before I get back .
Don ’ t wait up for me in case I should be late . ” “ How are you getting on ? ” “ Oh , so so .
Nothing to complain of .
I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last , but I did not call at the house .
It is a very sweet little problem , and I would not have missed it for a good deal .
However , I must not sit <unk> here , but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self . ” I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would <unk> .
His eyes twinkled , and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks .
He hastened upstairs , and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door , which told me that he was off once more upon his <unk> hunt .
I waited until midnight , but there was no sign of his return , so I retired to my room .
It was no <unk> thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent , so that his <unk> caused me no surprise .
I do not know at what hour he came in , but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other , as fresh and trim as possible .
“ You will excuse my beginning without you , Watson , ” said he , “ but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning . ” “ Why , it is after nine now , ” I answered .
“ I should not be surprised if that were he .
I thought I heard a ring . ” It was , indeed , our friend the financier .
I was shocked by the change which had come over him , for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould , was now <unk> and fallen in , while his hair seemed to me at least a shade <unk> .
He entered with a <unk> and <unk> which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before , and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him .
“ I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried , ” said he .
“ Only two days ago I was a happy and <unk> man , without a care in the world .
Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age .
One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another .
My niece , Mary , has deserted me . ” “ <unk> you ? ” “ Yes .
Her bed this morning had not been slept in , her room was empty , and a note for me lay upon the hall table .
I had said to her last night , in sorrow and not in anger , that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him .
Perhaps it was <unk> of me to say so .
It is to that remark that she refers in this note : “ ‘ MY <unk> <unk> , — I feel that I have brought trouble upon you , and that if I had acted <unk> this terrible misfortune might never have occurred .
I cannot , with this thought in my mind , ever again be happy under your roof , and I feel that I must leave you forever .
Do not <unk> about my future , for that is provided for ; and , above all , do not search for me , for it will be <unk> labour and an <unk> to me .
In life or in death , I am ever your loving , “ ‘ <unk> . ’ “ What could she mean by that note , Mr. Holmes ?
Do you think it points to suicide ? ” “ No , no , nothing of the kind .
It is perhaps the best possible solution .
I trust , Mr. Holder , that you are nearing the end of your troubles . ” “ Ha !
You say so !
You have heard something , Mr. Holmes ; you have learned something !
Where are the gems ? ” “ You would not think £ 1000 apiece an <unk> sum for them ? ” “ I would pay ten . ” “ That would be unnecessary .
Three thousand will cover the matter .
And there is a little reward , I fancy .
Have you your <unk> ?
Here is a pen .
Better make it out for £ <unk> . ” With a dazed face the banker made out the required check .
Holmes walked over to his desk , took out a little <unk> piece of gold with three gems in it , and threw it down upon the table .
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up .
“ You have it ! ” he gasped .
“ I am saved !
I am saved ! ” The reaction of joy was as <unk> as his grief had been , and he <unk> his recovered gems to his bosom .
“ There is one other thing you owe , Mr. Holder , ” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly .
“ <unk> ! ” He caught up a pen .
“ <unk> the sum , and I will pay it . ” “ No , the debt is not to me .
You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad , your son , who has carried himself in this matter as I should be <unk> to see my own son do , should I ever chance to have one . ” “ Then it was not Arthur who took them ? ” “ I told you yesterday , and I <unk> to-day , that it was not . ” “ You are sure of it !
Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known . ” “ He knows it already .
When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him , and finding that he would not tell me the story , I told it to him , on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me .
Your news of this morning , however , may open his lips . ” “ For Heaven ’ s sake , tell me , then , what is this extraordinary mystery ! ” “ I will do so , and I will show you the steps by which I reached it .
And let me say to you , first , that which it is <unk> for me to say and for you to hear : there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary .
They have now fled together . ” “ My Mary ?
<unk> ! ” “ It is unfortunately more than possible ; it is certain .
<unk> you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you <unk> him into your family circle .
He is one of the most dangerous men in England — a ruined gambler , an absolutely desperate villain , a man without heart or conscience .
Your niece knew nothing of such men .
When he <unk> his vows to her , as he had done to a hundred before her , she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart .
The devil knows best what he said , but at least she became his <unk> and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening . ” “ I cannot , and I will not , believe it ! ” cried the banker with an ashen face .
“ I will tell you , then , what occurred in your house last night .
Your niece , when you had , as she thought , gone to your room , slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane .
His footmarks had pressed right through the snow , so long had he stood there .
She told him of the coronet .
His wicked lust for gold <unk> at the news , and he bent her to his will .
I have no doubt that she loved you , but there are women in whom the love of a lover <unk> all other loves , and I think that she must have been one .
She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs , on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants ’ <unk> with her <unk> lover , which was all perfectly true .
“ Your boy , Arthur , went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts .
In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door , so he rose and , looking out , was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room .
<unk> with astonishment , the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair .
Presently she emerged from the room again , and in the light of the <unk> your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands .
She passed down the stairs , and he , <unk> with horror , ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door , whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath .
He saw her stealthily open the window , hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom , and then closing it once more hurry back to her room , passing quite close to where he stood <unk> behind the curtain .
“ As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved .
But the instant that she was gone he realised how <unk> a misfortune this would be for you , and how all-important it was to set it right .
He rushed down , just as he was , in his bare feet , opened the window , sprang out into the snow , and ran down the lane , where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight .
Sir George Burnwell tried to get away , but Arthur caught him , and there was a struggle between them , your lad <unk> at one side of the coronet , and his opponent at the other .
In the scuffle , your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye .
Then something suddenly snapped , and your son , finding that he had the coronet in his hands , rushed back , closed the window , ascended to your room , and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene . ” “ Is it possible ? ” gasped the banker .
“ You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your <unk> thanks .
He could not explain the true state of affairs without <unk> one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands .
He took the more <unk> view , however , and <unk> her secret . ” “ And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet , ” cried Mr. Holder .
“ Oh , my God !
what a blind fool I have been !
And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes !
The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle .
How cruelly I have <unk> him ! ” “ When I arrived at the house , ” continued Holmes , “ I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me .
I knew that none had fallen since the evening before , and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions .
I passed along the tradesmen ’ s path , but found it all trampled down and <unk> .
Just beyond it , however , at the far side of the kitchen door , a woman had stood and talked with a man , whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg .
I could even tell that they had been disturbed , for the woman had run back swiftly to the door , as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks , while <unk> had waited a little , and then had gone away .
I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart , of whom you had already spoken to me , and inquiry showed it was so .
I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than <unk> tracks , which I took to be the police ; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me .
“ There was a double line of tracks of a <unk> man , and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with <unk> feet .
I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son .
The first had walked both ways , but the other had run swiftly , and as his tread was marked in places over the <unk> of the boot , it was obvious that he had passed after the other .
I followed them up and found they led to the hall window , where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting .
Then I walked to the other end , which was a hundred yards or more down the lane .
I saw where Boots had faced round , where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle , and , finally , where a few drops of blood had fallen , to show me that I was not mistaken .
Boots had then run down the lane , and another little <unk> of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt .
When he came to the highroad at the other end , I found that the pavement had been cleared , so there was an end to that clue .
“ On entering the house , however , I examined , as you remember , the sill and <unk> of the hall window with my lens , and I could at once see that someone had passed out .
I could distinguish the <unk> of an <unk> where the wet foot had been placed in coming in .
I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred .
A man had waited outside the window ; someone had brought the gems ; the deed had been <unk> by your son ; he had pursued the thief ; had struggled with him ; they had each tugged at the coronet , their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have <unk> .
He had returned with the <unk> , but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent .
So far I was clear .
The question now was , who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet ?
“ It is an old <unk> of mine that when you have <unk> the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth .
Now , I knew that it was not you who had brought it down , so there only remained your niece and the maids .
But if it were the maids , why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place ?
There could be no possible reason .
As he loved his cousin , however , there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret — the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one .
When I remembered that you had seen her at that window , and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again , my conjecture became a certainty .
“ And who could it be who was her confederate ?
A lover evidently , for who else could <unk> the love and <unk> which she must feel to you ?
I knew that you went out little , and that your circle of friends was a very limited one .
But among them was Sir George Burnwell .
I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women .
It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems .
Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him , he might still <unk> himself that he was safe , for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family .
“ Well , your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next .
I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George ’ s house , managed to pick up an acquaintance with his <unk> , learned that his master had cut his head the night before , and , finally , at the expense of six shillings , made all sure by <unk> a pair of his <unk> shoes .
With these I <unk> down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks . ” “ I saw an <unk> <unk> in the lane yesterday evening , ” said Mr. Holder .
“ Precisely .
It was I. I found that I had my man , so I came home and changed my clothes .
It was a delicate part which I had to play then , for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal , and I knew that so <unk> a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter .
I went and saw him .
At first , of course , he denied everything .
But when I gave him every particular that had occurred , he tried to <unk> and took down a <unk> from the wall .
I knew my man , however , and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike .
Then he became a little more reasonable .
I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held — £ 1000 apiece .
That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown .
‘ Why , dash it all ! ’ said he , ‘ I ’ ve let them go at six hundred for the three ! ’ I soon managed to get the address of the <unk> who had them , on <unk> him that there would be no prosecution .
<unk> I set to him , and after much <unk> I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece .
Then I looked in upon your son , told him that all was right , and eventually got to my bed about two o ’ clock , after what I may call a really hard day ’ s work . ” “ A day which has saved England from a great public scandal , ” said the banker , rising .
“ Sir , I cannot find words to thank you , but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done .
Your skill has indeed <unk> all that I have heard of it .
And now I must fly to my dear boy to <unk> to him for the wrong which I have done him .
As to what you tell me of poor Mary , it goes to my very heart .
Not even your skill can inform me where she is now . ” “ I think that we may safely say , ” returned Holmes , “ that she is <unk> Sir George Burnwell is .
It is equally certain , too , that whatever her sins are , they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment . ” XII .
THE ADVENTURE OF THE <unk> <unk> “ To the man who loves art for its own sake , ” remarked Sherlock Holmes , tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _ The <unk> <unk> _ , “ it is frequently in its least important and <unk> <unk> that the keenest pleasure is to be derived .
It is pleasant to me to observe , Watson , that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up , and , I am bound to say , occasionally to embellish , you have given <unk> not so much to the many _ causes <unk> _ and sensational <unk> in which I have <unk> but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves , but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical <unk> which I have made my special province . ” “ And yet , ” said I , smiling , “ I cannot quite hold myself <unk> from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records . ” “ You have erred , perhaps , ” he observed , taking up a glowing <unk> with the <unk> and lighting with it the long <unk> pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a <unk> rather than a <unk> mood — “ you have erred perhaps in <unk> to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of <unk> yourself to the task of <unk> upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only <unk> feature about the thing . ” “ It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter , ” I remarked with some <unk> , for I was <unk> by the <unk> which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend ’ s singular character .
“ No , it is not <unk> or <unk> , ” said he , answering , as was his wont , my thoughts rather than my words .
“ If I claim full justice for my art , it is because it is an <unk> thing — a thing beyond myself .
<unk> is common .
<unk> is rare .
Therefore it is upon the <unk> rather than upon the crime that you should dwell .
You have <unk> what should have been a course of <unk> into a series of tales . ” It was a cold morning of the early spring , and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street .
A thick fog rolled down between the lines of <unk> houses , and the opposing windows loomed like dark , shapeless <unk> through the heavy yellow <unk> .
Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of <unk> and metal , for the table had not been cleared yet .
Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning , <unk> <unk> into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last , having apparently given up his search , he had emerged in no very sweet temper to <unk> me upon my <unk> <unk> .
“ At the same time , ” he remarked after a pause , during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire , “ you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism , for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in , a fair <unk> do not treat of crime , in its legal sense , at all .
The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia , the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland , the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip , and the incident of the noble bachelor , were all matters which are outside the pale of the law .
But in <unk> the sensational , I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial . ” “ The end may have been so , ” I answered , “ but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest . ” “ Pshaw , my dear fellow , what do the public , the great <unk> public , who could hardly tell a <unk> by his <unk> or a <unk> by his left thumb , care about the finer <unk> of analysis and deduction !
But , indeed , if you are trivial , I cannot blame you , for the days of the great cases are past .
Man , or at least criminal man , has lost all <unk> and <unk> .
As to my own little practice , it seems to be <unk> into an agency for recovering lost lead <unk> and giving advice to young ladies from <unk> .
I think that I have touched bottom at last , however .
This note I had this morning marks my <unk> , I fancy .
Read it ! ” He tossed a crumpled letter across to me .
It was dated from <unk> Place upon the preceding evening , and ran thus : “ DEAR MR. HOLMES , — I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess .
I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you .
Yours faithfully , “ <unk> HUNTER . ” “ Do you know the young lady ? ” I asked .
“ Not I. ” “ It is half-past ten now . ” “ Yes , and I have no doubt that is her ring . ” “ It may turn out to be of more interest than you think .
You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle , which appeared to be a mere whim at first , developed into a serious investigation .
It may be so in this case , also . ” “ Well , let us hope so .
But our doubts will very soon be solved , for here , unless I am much mistaken , is the person in question . ” As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room .
She was plainly but neatly dressed , with a bright , quick face , <unk> like a <unk> ’ s egg , and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world .
“ You will excuse my <unk> you , I am sure , ” said she , as my companion rose to <unk> her , “ but I have had a very strange experience , and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice , I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do . ” “ Pray take a seat , Miss Hunter .
I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you . ” I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client .
He looked her over in his searching fashion , and then composed himself , with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together , to listen to her story .
“ I have been a governess for five years , ” said she , “ in the family of Colonel Spence Munro , but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , and took his children over to America with him , so that I found myself without a situation .
I advertised , and I answered <unk> , but without success .
At last the little money which I had saved began to run short , and I was at my wit ’ s end as to what I should do .
“ There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway ’ s , and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me .
Westaway was the name of the <unk> of the business , but it is really managed by Miss Stoper .
She sits in her own little office , and the ladies who are <unk> <unk> wait in an <unk> , and are then shown in one by one , when she <unk> her <unk> and sees whether she has anything which would suit them .
“ Well , when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual , but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone .
A <unk> stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose , looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered .
As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper .
“ ‘ That will do , ’ said he ; ‘ I could not ask for anything better .
Capital !
capital ! ’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion .
He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him .
“ ‘ You are looking for a situation , miss ? ’ he asked .
“ ‘ Yes , sir . ’ “ ‘ As governess ? ’ “ ‘ Yes , sir . ’ “ ‘ And what salary do you ask ? ’ “ ‘ I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro . ’ “ ‘ Oh , tut , tut !
sweating — <unk> sweating ! ’ he cried , throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a <unk> passion .
‘ How could anyone offer so <unk> a sum to a lady with such <unk> and accomplishments ? ’ “ ‘ My accomplishments , sir , may be less than you imagine , ’ said I.
‘ A little French , a little German , music , and drawing — ’ “ ‘ Tut , tut ! ’ he cried .
‘ This is all quite beside the question .
The point is , have you or have you not the bearing and <unk> of a lady ?
There it is in a <unk> .
If you have not , you are not fitted for the <unk> of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country .
But if you have why , then , how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures ?
Your salary with me , madam , would commence at £ 100 a year . ’ “ You may imagine , Mr. Holmes , that to me , <unk> as I was , such an offer seemed almost too good to be true .
The gentleman , however , seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face , opened a <unk> and took out a note .
“ ‘ It is also my custom , ’ said he , smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining <unk> amid the white creases of his face , ‘ to advance to my young ladies half their salary <unk> , so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe . ’ “ It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man .
As I was already in debt to my tradesmen , the advance was a great convenience , and yet there was something unnatural about the whole <unk> which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself .
“ ‘ May I ask where you live , sir ? ’ said I.
“ ‘ Hampshire .
<unk> <unk> place .
The Copper Beeches , five miles on the far side of Winchester .
It is the most lovely country , my dear young lady , and the <unk> old <unk> . ’ “ ‘ And my duties , sir ?
I should be glad to know what they would be . ’ “ ‘ One child — one dear little <unk> just six years old .
Oh , if you could see him <unk> <unk> with a <unk> !
<unk> !
smack !
smack !
Three gone before you could wink ! ’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again .
“ I was a little startled at the nature of the child ’ s amusement , but the father ’ s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking .
“ ‘ My sole duties , then , ’ I asked , ‘ are to take charge of a single child ? ’ “ ‘ No , no , not the sole , not the sole , my dear young lady , ’ he cried .
‘ Your duty would be , as I am sure your good sense would suggest , to obey any little commands my wife might give , provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey .
You see no difficulty , <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ I should be happy to make myself useful . ’ “ ‘ Quite so .
In dress now , for example .
